  abstract = {The expanding use of digital photography for marine mammal photo-identification has created a need for tools to analyze and manage growing image file archives. While database management systems have been commonly employed to manage text and numerical data generated by photo-identification research, their use for the analysis and management of associated image files has been limited. This paper describes a photo-identification database management system with embedded image analysis and management capabilities. Matching and cataloging are expedited using a multiple-attribute, non-metric catalog sorting algorithm. Algorithm efficiency at locating catalog matches for bottlenose dolphins was compared to the performance of a more traditional singleattribute, non-metric approach. Locating catalog matches under the multiple-attribute approach required at least 50\% fewer comparisons for 90\% of the 409 individuals tested. For 50\% of the individuals, 80\% fewer comparisons were required. System utility is further extended through embedded mapping components that allow researchers to visually inspect sighting locations following each survey and to examine sighting histories for specific individuals. In addition, a companion ArcGIS\texttrademark{} extension allows researchers to quickly explore and interact with the photo-identification data within a GIS environment. This system, while created for a bottlenose dolphin research application, can be adapted to accommodate photo-identification research on a variety of other species.},

  abstract = {Robust recovery of lost colors in underwater images remains a challenging problem. We recently showed that this was partly due to the prevalent use of an atmospheric image formation model for underwater images and proposed a physically accurate model. The revised model showed: 1) the attenuation coefficient of the signal is not uniform across the scene but depends on object range and reflectance, 2) the coefficient governing the increase in backscatter with distance differs from the signal attenuation coefficient. Here, we present the first method that recovers color with our revised model, using RGBD images. The Sea-thru method estimates backscatter using the dark pixels and their known range information. Then, it uses an estimate of the spatially varying illuminant to obtain the range-dependent attenuation coefficient. Using more than 1,100 images from two optically different water bodies, which we make available, we show that our method with the revised model outperforms those using the atmospheric model. Consistent removal of water will open up large underwater datasets to powerful computer vision and machine learning algorithms, creating exciting opportunities for the future of underwater exploration and conservation.},

  abstract = {The term Deep Learning or Deep Neural Network refers to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with multi layers. Over the last few decades, it has been considered to be one of the most powerful tools, and has become very popular in the literature as it is able to handle a huge amount of data. The interest in having deeper hidden layers has recently begun to surpass classical methods performance in different fields; especially in pattern recognition. One of the most popular deep neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It take this name from mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN have multiple layers; including convolutional layer, non-linearity layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer. The convolutional and fully-connected layers have parameters but pooling and non-linearity layers don't have parameters. The CNN has an excellent performance in machine learning problems. Specially the applications that deal with image data, such as largest image classification data set (Image Net), computer vision, and in natural language processing (NLP) and the results achieved were very amazing. In this paper we will explain and define all the elements and important issues related to CNN, and how these elements work. In addition, we will also state the parameters that effect CNN efficiency. This paper assumes that the readers have adequate knowledge about both machine learning and artificial neural network.},

  abstract = {Pilot whales Globicephala spp. are known to display a hierarchical social pattern, but longitudinal data to infer population structure of short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus are rare. Using data collected between 2003-2011 in the oceanic archipelago of Madeira, the grouping structure of short-finned pilot whales was studied using photo-identification methods and mtDNA sequences and microsatellite markers to test the hypotheses that (1) there is at least one pelagic and one or more island-associated communities, and (2) groups are made of related individuals, with a matrilineal social structure. Pilot whales demonstrated a large degree of variability in site fidelity, including residents (up to 14-year interval), regular visitors and transients. The social and temporal analyses revealed a well-differentiated society with long-lasting relationships (of years). The genetic analyses suggested that individuals of the three residency patterns may not be genetically isolated, and that small groups are made up of related individuals, suggesting some degree of social philopatry, while large groups are probably temporary associations of smaller groups. It is proposed that the pilot whales encountered in Madeira belong to a single population encompassing several clans, possibly three clans of island-associated whales and others of transients, each containing two to three matrilineal pods, each with a mean of 15 individuals (SD=9, range: 4-29). We suggest that the clans interact for mating purposes when they meet. For management decisions, it is considered that the island-associated whales should not be regarded as demographically independent populations, but instead as stable social entities to be included in governmental management plans and requiring periodic evaluation of their status. The high proportion of marked individuals and low rate of mark change encourages further research in this species. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Tags allow researchers to track the movement patterns, habitat use andother aspects of the behaviour of animals that are otherwise difficult to observe. They can even be used to monitor the physiology of a taggedanimal within its changing environment. Such tags are ideal for identifying and predicting responses to anthropogenic threats, thus facilitating thedevelopment of robust mitigation measures. With the increasing need for data best provided by tagging and the increasing availability of tags, suchresearch is becoming more common. Tagging can, however, pose risks to the health and welfare of cetaceans and to personnel involved in taggingoperations. Here we provide `best practice' recommendations for cetacean tag design, deployment and follow-up assessment of tagged individuals,compiled by biologists and veterinarians with significant experience in cetacean tagging. This paper is intended to serve as a resource to assist tagusers, veterinarians, ethics committees and regulatory agency staff in the implementation of high standards of practice, and to promote the trainingof specialists in this area. Standardised terminology for describing tag design and illustrations of tag types and attachment sites are provided, alongwith protocols for tag testing and deployment (both remote and through capture-release), including training of operators. The recommendationsemphasise the importance of ensuring that tagging is ethically and scientifically justified for a particular project and that tagging only be used toaddress bona fide research or conservation questions that are best addressed with tagging, as supported by an exploration of alternative methods.Recommendations are provided for minimising effects on individual animals (e.g. through careful selection of the individual, tag design and implantsterilisation) and for improving knowledge of tagging effects on cetaceans through increased post-tagging monitoring.},

This image representation is developed by encoding the global geometric relationships of visual words in the 2D image plane in a scale- and rotation-invariant manner. In this way, invariance is achieved to the most common variations found in the images of these animals as they can be imaged at different image locations, exhibit various in-plane orientations and have various scales in the images. The images in our butterfly and reef fish datasets belong to 30 species of each animal. We achieve better classification rates on both the datasets than the ordinary BoVWs model while still being invariant to the mentioned image variations. Our proposed image-based classification framework for butterfly and reef fish species can be considered as a helpful tool for scientific research, conversation and education.},

Here, we employed pop-up archival tags, data mining and dedicated effort to understand an aggregation of whale sharks at Honda Bay, Palawan, Philippines, and its role in the species' conservation. Between Apr and Oct 2018, we conducted 159 surveys identifying 117 individual whale sharks through their unique spot patterns (96.5\% male, mean 4.5\,m). A further 66 individual whale sharks were identified from local operators, and data mined on social media platforms. The satellite telemetry data showed that the whale sharks moved broadly, with one individual moving to Sabah, Malaysia, before returning to the site {$<$}1 year later. Similarly, another tagged whale shark returned to the site at a similar periodicity after reaching the Malay-Filipino border.

  abstract = {The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is a charismatic umbrella species whose highly mobile nature is not yet fully understood. Whale sharks roam the Philippine archipelago with two major aggregations known to occur at Donsol and at a provisioning site in Cebu. This is the first description of a previously identified aggregation occurring off Panaon Island, Southern Leyte through the use of photographic identification. In total, 93 individual whale sharks were identified, with significant male bias (58\%). The mean estimated total length of individuals was 5.72 {$\pm$} 1.02 m S.D., indicating a juvenile aggregation. Partial or complete fin amputations, potentially resulting from fishing lines, boat propellers or net entanglement, were observed on 27\% of animals, highlighting some of the risks human activities can have on this threatened species. Multiple parallel scars, identified as propeller impact, were observed on 45\% of animals. Dedicated research seasons in 2013 and 2014 yielded very different whale shark encounters with 366 in 2013 and 12 in 2014, yet highlighted the recurrence of individuals at the study site. Complemented by data collected through citizen science, maximum likelihood methods were used to model mean residency of whale sharks at Panaon Island of 27.04 days. The modelled lagged identification rate showed that many whale sharks return to the study site over time. Whale sharks from Panaon Island were identified through photo-ID and citizen science at other sites in the Philippines, as well as a match to Taiwan, representing the first international match through photo-ID in South-east Asia with a minimum distance covered of 1600 km. Given the highly mobile nature and recent exploitation of this species, management is recommended as a single unit regionally in South-east Asia. Additional research is needed to focus on the drivers of variation in encounters at whale shark aggregation sites. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Robust deep learning architectures have been used to improve the classification performance in such a fine-grained problem but usually build models that are highly dependent on a large training dataset and are not scalable. This paper proposes a novel method based on a two-view leaf image representation and a hierarchical classification strategy for fine-grained plant species recognition. It uses the botanical taxonomy as a basis for a coarse-to-fine strategy applied to identify the plant genus and species. The two-view representation provides complementary global and local features of leaf images. A deep metric based on Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks is used to reduce the dependence on many training samples and make the method scalable to new plant species. The experimental results on two challenging fine-grained datasets of leaf images (i.e., PlantCLEF 2015 and LeafSnap) have shown the proposed method's effectiveness, which achieved recognition accuracy of 0.87 and 0.96, respectively.},

In June 2018, videos of reef manta rays from the SS Yongala (19.31\textdegree{} S, 147.62\textdegree{} E), were submitted to the Project Manta east coast sightings database. The videos were of two individuals previously identified from North Stradbroke Island (27.42\textdegree{} S, 153.55\textdegree{} E), about 1150 km to the south of the SS Yongala. This represents the greatest point-to-point distance travelled by individual M. afredi and extends the latitudinal range for this sub-population on the east coast. This study highlights that citizen science input can provide valuable data to address knowledge gaps in the distribution and population range of marine species. Knowledge of the 1000+ km range movement potential of individual M. alfredi, highlights the possibility that regional sub-populations may span jurisdictional zones of more countries than previously considered likely, complicating conservation management of this species.},

  abstract = {Newly emerging variants of ransomware pose an ever-growing threat to computer systems governing every aspect of modern life through the handling and analysis of big data. While various recent security-based approaches have focused on detecting and classifying ransomware at the network or system level, easy-to-use post-infection ransomware classification for the lay user has not been attempted before. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of classifying the ransomware a system is infected with simply based on a screenshot of the splash screen or the ransom note captured using a consumer camera commonly found in any modern mobile device. To train and evaluate our system, we create a sample dataset of the splash screens of 50 well-known ransomware variants. In our dataset, only a single training image is available per ransomware. Instead of creating a large training dataset of ransomware screenshots, we simulate screenshot capture conditions via carefully designed data augmentation techniques, enabling simple and efficient oneshot learning. Moreover, using model uncertainty obtained via Bayesian approximation, we ensure special input cases such as unrelated non-ransomware images and previously-unseen ransomware variants are correctly identified for special handling and not mis-classified. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our work, with accuracy levels of up to 93.6\% for ransomware classification.},

  abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3], DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

In Hawaiian waters a single stock is recognized of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, a species that is found both in open water and near-shore among the main Hawaiian Islands. To assess population structure, we photo-identified 336 distinctive individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands, from 2000 to 2006. Their generally shallow-water distribution, and numerous within-year and between-year resightings within island areas suggest that individuals are resident to the islands, rather than part of an offshore population moving through the area. Comparisons of identifications obtained from Kaua`i/Ni`ihau, O`ahu, the ``4-island area,'' and the island of Hawai`i showed no evidence of movements among these island groups, although movements from Kaua`i to Ni`ihau and among the ``4-islands'' were documented. A Bayesian analysis examining the probability of missing movements among island groups, given our sample sizes for different areas, indicates that interisland movement rates are less than 1\% per year with 95\% probability. Our results suggest the existence of multiple demographically independent populations of island-associated common bottlenose dolphins around the main Hawaiian islands.},

This study presents an overview of elasmobranch catch, trade and socio-economic characteristics of Zanzibar's small-scale, artisanal fishery. The value of applying this information to future elasmobranch fisheries policy is demonstrated. In August 2015, interviews were conducted with fishers (n = 39) and merchants (n = 16) at two landing sites, Kizimkazi-Dimbani and Mkokotoni, along with the main market site in Stone Town. Additionally, elasmobranch catches were recorded across the same locations between June and August 2015. Elasmobranchs were listed as target species by 49\% of fishers interviewed. Whilst most fishers (n = 30) stated that 76\textendash 100\% of their household income came from fishing, there was variation in how elasmobranch catch and trade contributed. One-third of fishers (n = 36) that caught and sold elasmobranchs reported that 41\textendash 60\% of their income came from elasmobranch catch. However, for some fishers (n = 8) elasmobranch catch represented 0\textendash 20\% of their income, whilst for others (n = 4) it represented 81\textendash 100\%. Differences in fisheries income and elasmobranch price could be attributed to several interacting factors including season, weather, fishing effort, fishing gear, target catch and consumer demand. Further, elasmobranch price was influenced by size and species. The study revealed information on catch, trade, markets and socio-economy that is important for future research, conservation and management of elasmobranchs and fisheries in Zanzibar. The methods utilised have potential for broader application to understudied, artisanal elasmobranch fisheries in the western Indian Ocean.},

To help with this aim, a number of datasets have been released which can be used to train Deep Learning systems \textendash{} these have produced impressive results for classification. However, this only works for the classes they are trained on whilst they are incapable of identifying skin lesions from previously unseen classes, making them unconducive for clinical use. We could look to massively increase the datasets by including all possible skin lesions, though this would always leave out some classes. Instead, we evaluate Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs), which not only allows us to classify images of skin lesions, but also allow us to identify those images which are different from the trained classes \textendash{} allowing us to determine that an image is not an example of our training classes. We evaluate SNNs on both dermoscopic and clinical images of skin lesions. We obtain top-1 classification accuracy levels of 74.33\% and 85.61\% on clinical and dermoscopic datasets, respectively. Although this is slightly lower than the state-of-the-art results, the SNN approach has the advantage that it can detect out-of-class examples. Our results highlight the potential of an SNN approach as well as pathways towards future clinical deployment.},

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF's application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF's usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

In order to tackle this problem, we have prepared a dataset and challenge where the training data and test data are from different regions, namely The American Southwest and the American Northwest. We use the Caltech Camera Traps dataset, collected from the American Southwest, as training data. We add a new dataset from the American Northwest, curated from data provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), as our test dataset. The test data has some class overlap with the training data, some species are found in both datasets, but there are both species seen during training that are not seen during test and vice versa. To help fill the gaps in the training species, we allow competitors to utilize transfer learning from two alternate domains: human-curated images from iNaturalist and synthetic images from Microsoft's TrapCam-AirSim simulation environment.},

The current decline in biodiversity requires a transformation from manual, periodic assessment to automatic real-time biodiversity monitoring. Bats as one of the most widespread species among terrestrial mammals serve as important bioindicators for the health of ecosystems. Typically, bats are monitored by recording and analyzing their echolocation calls. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting bat echolocation calls and recognizing bat species in audio spectrograms. It is based on a transformer neural network architecture and relies on self-attention. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bat echolocation call detection and species recognition on several publicly available data sets. While our bat echolocation call detection approach achieves a performance of up to 90.2\% in terms of average precision, our bat species recognition model obtains up to 88.7\% accuracy for 14 bat classes occurring in Germany, some of which are difficult to distinguish even for human experts.},

  abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

Photographic data have been used to identify lacaziosis-like disease (LLD) among dolphins in the waters of North and South America, and here we report LLD in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus off the coast of Costa Rica, the first reporting in Central American waters. During the periods of 1991 to 1992 and 2010 to 2011, 3 research teams conducted separate dolphin surveys in the Pacific tropical fiord Golfo Dulce, and each documented skin lesions in the resident population of bottlenose dolphins. Photo-ID records were used to identify LLD-affected bottlenose dolphins and to assess their lesions. Findings showed between 13.2 and 16.1\% of the identified dolphins exhibited lesions grossly resembling lacaziosis. By combining efforts and cross-referencing photographic data, the teams explored the presence of LLD in Golfo Dulce over a time gap of approximately 20 yr. Our findings expand the geographical range of the disease and offer insight into its longevity within a given population of dolphins.},

  abstract = {Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, Chelonia mydas, flatback turtles, Natator depressus, hawksbill turtles, Eretmochelys imbricata), saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), and crested terns (Thalasseus bergii) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20\textendash 30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.},

  abstract = {The classification of a table as round rather than square, a car as a Mazda rather than a Ford, a drill bit as 3/8-inch rather than 1/4-inch, and a face as Tom have all been regarded as a single process termed ``subordinate classification.'' Despite the common label, the considerable heterogeneity of the perceptual processing required to achieve such classifications requires, minimally, a more detailed taxonomy. Perceptual information relevant to subordinate-level shape classifications can be presumed to vary on continua of (a) the type of distinctive information that is present, nonaccidental or metric, (b) the size of the relevant contours or surfaces, and (c) the similarity of the to-be-discriminated features, such as whether a straight contour has to be distinguished from a contour of low curvature versus high curvature. We consider three, relatively pure cases. Case 1 subordinates may be distinguished by a representation, a geon structural description (GSD), specifying a nonaccidental characterization of an object's large parts and the relations among these parts, such as a round table versus a square table. Case 2 subordinates are also distinguished by GSDs, except that the distinctive GSDs are present at a small scale in a complex object so the location and mapping of the GSDs are contingent on an initial basic-level classification, such as when we use a logo to distinguish various makes of cars. Expertise for Cases 1 and 2 can be easily achieved through specification, often verbal, of the GSDs. Case 3 subordinates, which have furnished much of the grist for theorizing with ``view-based'' template models, require fine metric discriminations. Cases 1 and 2 account for the overwhelming majority of shape-based basic- and subordinate-level object classifications that people can and do make in their everyday lives. These classifications are typically made quickly, accurately, and with only modest costs of viewpoint changes. Whereas the activation of an array of multiscale, multiorientation filters, presumed to be at the initial stage of all shape processing, may suffice for determining the similarity of the representations mediating recognition among Case 3 subordinate stimuli (and faces), Cases 1 and 2 require that the output of these filters be mapped to classifiers that make explicit the nonaccidental properties, parts, and relations specified by the GSDs.},

  abstract = {A solitary male bottlenose dolphin was resident close to the fishing port of Amble from April 1987 (Bloom 1991). This animal remained in a very small triangular home range of less than 0.5 km and was rarely seen to leave that established territory. The home range was contained within Alnmouth Bay between Cocquet Island and associated shoals and the mainland. This shallow protected bay area provided good protection from gales and storms from most directions. The boundaries, as defined by the dolphin\&\#39;s observed movements, are the Pan Bush shoals and its navigational buoy to the north\- east, the sewer outfall buoy to the south and the harbour mouth area on the westward apex of the triangle (see Figure 1). The river Coquet is a fine salmon and seatrout river. Since these fish, by instinct, have to pass through the narrow harbour entrance to gain access to and egress from, the river estuary, they provided a regular supply of large fish that were therefore concentrated into a predictable and small forage area. This was perhaps the primary reason for this animal\&\#39;s prolonged residency in the Amble area. It was the dolphin\&\#39;s increasing interest in commercial fishing and recreational boat traffic, and later with swimmers, that brought this animal into intimate contact with people and their activities.},

However, manually matching photographs to known individuals is time-consuming. Motivated by recent developments in image recognition, we hosted a data science challenge on the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to automate the identification of endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). The winning solution automatically identified individual whales with 87\% accuracy with a series of convolutional neural networks to identify the region of interest on an image, rotate, crop, and create standardized photographs of uniform size and orientation and then identify the correct individual whale from these passport-like photographs. Recent advances in deep learning coupled with this fully automated workflow have yielded impressive results and have the potential to revolutionize traditional methods for the collection of data on the abundance and distribution of wild populations. Presenting these results to a broad audience should further bridge the gap between the data science and conservation science communities.},

Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional. Finally, we also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty.},

In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set.},

  abstract = {To ensure effective cetacean management and conservation policies, it is necessary to collect and rigorously analyze data about these populations. Remote sensing allows the acquisition of images over large observation areas, but due to the lack of reliable automatic analysis techniques, biologists usually analyze all images by hand. In this paper, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach to couple the power of deep learning-based automation with the expertise of biologists to develop a reliable artificial intelligence assisted annotation tool for cetacean monitoring. We tested this approach to analyze a dataset of 5334 aerial images acquired in 2017 by Fisheries and Oceans Canada to monitor belugas (               Delphinapterus leucas               ) from the threatened Cumberland Sound population in Clearwater Fjord, Canada. First, we used a test subset of photographs to compare predictions obtained by the fine-tuned model to manual annotations made by three Observers, expert marine mammal biologists. With only 100 annotated images for training, the model obtained between 90\% and 91.4\% mutual agreement with the three Observers, exceeding the minimum inter-observer agreement of 88.6\% obtained between the experts themselves. Second, this model was applied to the full dataset. The predictions were then verified by an Observer and compared to annotations made completely manually and independently by another Observer. The annotating Observer and the human-in-the-loop pipeline detected 4051 belugas in common, out of a total of 4572 detections for the Observer and 4298 for our pipeline. This experiment shows that the proposed human-in-the-loop approach is suitable for processing novel aerial datasets for beluga counting and can be used to scale cetacean monitoring. It also highlights that human observers, even experienced ones, have varied detection bias, underlining the need to discuss standardization of annotation protocols.},

Traditional photo-id involves a laborious manual process of matching each dolphin fin photograph captured in the field to a catalogue of known individuals. We examine this problem in the context of open-set recognition and utilise a triplet loss function to learn a compact representation of fin images in a Euclidean embedding, where the Euclidean distance metric represents fin similarity. We show that this compact representation can be successfully learnt from a fairly small (in deep learning context) training set and still generalise well to out-of-sample identities (completely new dolphin individuals), with top-1 and top-5 test set (37 individuals) accuracy of 90.5 {$\pm$} 2 and 93.6 {$\pm$} 1 percent. In the presence of 1200 distractors, top-1 accuracy dropped by 12\%; however, top-5 accuracy saw only a 2.8\% drop.},

  abstract = {Many modern visual recognition algorithms incorporate a step of spatial `pooling', where the outputs of several nearby feature detectors are combined into a local or global `bag of features', in a way that preserves task-related information while removing irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.},

Our proposed triple stream embedding architecture works on camera trap videos taken directly in the wild and demonstrates that the utilisation of an explicit DensePose-C chimpanzee body part segmentation stream effectively complements traditional RGB appearance and optical flow streams. We evaluate system variants with different feature fusion techniques and long-tail recognition approaches. Results and ablations show performance improvements of \textasciitilde 12\% in top-1 accuracy over previous results achieved on the PanAf-500 dataset containing 180,000 manually annotated frames across nine behavioural actions. Furthermore, we provide a qualitative analysis of our findings and augment the metric learning system with long-tail recognition techniques showing that average per class accuracy -- critical in the domain -- can be improved by \textasciitilde 23\% compared to the literature on that dataset. Finally, since our embedding spaces are constructed as metric, we provide first data-driven visualisations of the great ape behavioural action spaces revealing emerging geometry and topology. We hope that the work sparks further interest in this vital application area of computer vision for the benefit of endangered great apes.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions \textendash{} something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report on the context and evaluation of a system for an automatic interpretation of sightings of individual western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) as captured in facial field photography in the wild. This effort aligns with a growing need for effective and integrated monitoring approaches for assessing the status of biodiversity at high spatio-temporal scales. Manual field photography and the utilisation of autonomous camera traps have already transformed the way ecological surveys are conducted. In principle, many environments can now be monitored continuously, and with a higher spatio-temporal resolution than ever before. Yet, the manual effort required to process photographic data to derive relevant information delimits any large scale application of this methodology. The described system applies existing computer vision techniques including deep convolutional neural networks to cover the tasks of detection and localisation, as well as individual identification of gorillas in a practically relevant setup. We evaluate the approach on a relatively large and challenging data corpus of 12,765 field images of 147 individual gorillas with image-level labels (i.e. missing bounding boxes) photographed at Mbeli Bai at the Nouabal-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo. Results indicate a facial detection rate of 90.8\% AP and an individual identification accuracy for ranking within the Top 5 set of 80.3\%. We conclude that, whilst keeping the human in the loop is critical, this result is practically relevant as it exemplifies model transferability and has the potential to assist manual identification efforts. We argue further that there is significant need towards integrating computer vision deeper into ecological sampling methodologies and field practice to move the discipline forward and open up new research horizons.},

  abstract = {In object detection, an intersection over union (IoU) threshold is required to define positives and negatives. An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains independently of the baseline detector strength. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoweicai/cascade-rcnn.},

  abstract = {An Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (Montague), with a damaged dorsal fin was observed by the author on November 1, 1953, at approximately 0900 at Cedar Key, Florida. The healed injury, the absence of the upper two-thirds of the fin, served as a natural "tag" and permitted ready identification of this individual, even in the brief period of a normal breathing roll. This dolphin was again seen in mid-afternoon on January 24, 1954, and a third time at 1430 on March 20,1954. The first observation was made in the main ship channel between Atsena Otie and Grassy Keys, approximately 1600 yards SSW of the main pier. On the second observation, the dolphin was again in the main ship channel about 200 yards east of the main pier, and approximately 600 yards WSW of the pier in the same channel on the third sighting. Joining these reference points (Mohr, Amer. Midi. Nat., 37: 233, 1947), an area of some 475,000 square yards is yielded as an estimated minimum home range for this animal at Cedar Key. Further observations would undoubtedly affect this calculation, and may show that the animal is actually restricted to the channel at Cedar Key and does not include some of the shallower flats in its home range, as would be indicated by the theoretical area encompassed by this approximation. On the other hand, it cannot of course be concluded from the small sample that this area actually corresponds to the full home range of this individual.},

  abstract = {Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Instance segmentation is one of the fundamental vision tasks. Recently, fully convolutional instance segmentation methods have drawn much attention as they are often simpler and more efficient than two-stage approaches like Mask R-CNN. To date, almost all such approaches fall behind the two-stage Mask R-CNN method in mask precision when models have similar computation complexity, leaving great room for improvement. In this work, we achieve improved mask prediction by effectively combining instance-level information with semantic information with lower-level fine-granularity. Our main contribution is a blender module which draws inspiration from both top-down and bottom-up instance segmentation approaches. The proposed BlendMask can effectively predict dense per-pixel position-sensitive instance features with very few channels, and learn attention maps for each instance with merely one convolution layer, thus being fast in inference. BlendMask can be easily incorporated with the state-of-the-art one-stage detection frameworks and outperforms Mask R-CNN under the same training schedule while being 20\% faster. A light-weight version of BlendMask achieves \$ 34.2\% \$ mAP at 25 FPS evaluated on a single 1080Ti GPU card. Because of its simplicity and efficacy, we hope that our BlendMask could serve as a simple yet strong baseline for a wide range of instance-wise prediction tasks.

  abstract = {Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\% and 82.1\% without any post-processing.

  abstract = {Cascade is a classic yet powerful architecture that has boosted performance on various tasks. However, how to introduce cascade to instance segmentation remains an open question. A simple combination of Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN only brings limited gain. In exploring a more effective approach, we find that the key to a successful instance segmentation cascade is to fully leverage the reciprocal relationship between detection and segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), which differs in two important aspects: (1) instead of performing cascaded refinement on these two tasks separately, it interweaves them for a joint multi-stage processing; (2) it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can help distinguishing hard foreground from cluttered background. Overall, this framework can learn more discriminative features progressively while integrating complementary features together in each stage. Without bells and whistles, a single HTC obtains 38.4\% and 1.5\% improvement over a strong Cascade Mask R-CNN baseline on MSCOCO dataset. Moreover, our overall system achieves 48.6 mask AP on the test-challenge split, ranking 1st in the COCO 2018 Challenge Object Detection Task.

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.},

  abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called ''semantic image segmentation''). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our ``DeepLab'' system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6\% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.},

  abstract = {The distribution, movements and abundance of highly mobile marine species such as bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are best studied at large spatial scales, but previous research effort has generally been focused on relatively small areas, occupied by populations with high site fidelity. We aimed to characterize the distribution, movements and abundance of bottlenose dolphins around the coasts of Scotland, exploring how data from multiple sources could be integrated to build a broader-scale picture of their ecology. We reviewed existing historical data, integrated data from ongoing studies and developed new collaborative studies to describe distribution patterns. We adopted a Bayesian multi-site mark-recapture model to estimate abundance of bottlenose dolphins throughout Scottish coastal waters and quantified movements of individuals between study areas. The majority of sightings of bottlenose dolphins around the Scottish coastline are concentrated on the east and west coasts, but records are rare before the 1990s. Dedicated photo-identification studies in 2006 and 2007 were used to estimate the size of two resident populations: one on the east coast from the Moray Firth to Fife, population estimate 195 [95\% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162\textendash 253] and the second in the Hebrides, population estimate 45 (95\% HPDI: 33\textendash 66). Interaction parameters demonstrated that the dolphins off the east coast of Scotland are highly mobile, whereas those off the west coast form two discrete communities. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of the abundance of bottlenose dolphins in the inshore waters of Scotland. The combination of dedicated photo-identification studies and opportunistic sightings suggest that a relatively small number of bottlenose dolphins (200\textendash 300 individuals) occur regularly in Scottish coastal waters. On both east and west coasts, re-sightings of identifiable individuals indicate that the animals have been using these coastal areas since studies began.},

We use a 21 year time series of bottlenose dolphin photo-identification data to assess trends in abundance and conservation status within a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in Scotland. Mark\textendash recapture methods were used to estimate annual abundance within the SAC from 1990 to 2010. A Bayesian mark\textendash recapture model with a state-space approach was used to estimate overall population trends using data collected across the populations' range. Despite inter-annual variability in the number of dolphins within the SAC, there was a {$>$}99\% probability that the wider population was stable or increasing. Results indicate that use of the SAC by the wider population has declined. This is the first evidence of long-term trends in the use of an EU protected area by small cetaceans in relation to changes in overall population status. Our results highlight the importance of adapting the survey protocols used in long-term photo-identification studies to maintain high capture probabilities and minimise sampling heterogeneity. Crucially, these data demonstrate the value of collecting data from the wider population to assess the success of protected areas designated for mobile predators.},

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

Groupfollows were conducted from a carefully maneuvered (non-invasive) independent research vessel and behavioural data on group activity were collected using scan sampling methods. By using a timediscrete Markov chain model, the transition probabilities of passing/changing from one behavioural state to another were calculated and compared between impact and control situations. The data were further used to construct behavioural budgets. In the presence of tourist boats, dolphins were less likely to stay in a resting or socialising activity but were more likely to start travelling or foraging, as inferred from the Markov chain model. The behavioral budgets showed that foraging, resting and socialising all decreased as an effect of tourist boat presence, while travelling increased. The behavioural responses are likely to have energetic implications, mainly by increasing physical demands. Further, the results demonstrate that the current level of tourism intensity off the south coast of Zanzibar affects the dolphins' cumulative behavioural budget. Regulations on dolphin tourism are therefore urgently needed to minimise potential long-term negative effects on the dolphins.},

This letter reports on the development of a novel deep learning-based apple detection framework named DeepApple. Specifically, we first collect a comprehensive apple orchard dataset for 'Gala' and 'Blondee' apples, using a color camera, under different lighting conditions (sunny vs. overcast and front lighting vs. back lighting). We then develop a novel suppression Mask R-CNN for apple detection, in which a suppression branch is added to the standard Mask R-CNN to suppress non-apple features generated by the original network. Comprehensive evaluations are performed, which show that the developed suppression Mask R-CNN network outperforms state-of-the-art models with a higher F1-score of 0.905 and a detection time of 0.25 second per frame on a standard desktop computer.},

  abstract = {Emerging technologies support a new era of applied wildlife research, generating data on scales from individuals to populations. Computer vision methods can process large datasets generated through image-based techniques by automating the detection and identification of species and individuals. With the exception of primates, however, there are no objective visual methods of individual identification for species that lack unique and consistent body markings. We apply deep learning approaches of facial recognition using object detection, landmark detection, a similarity comparison network, and an support vector machine-based classifier to identify individuals in a representative species, the brown bear Ursus arctos. Our open-source application, BearID, detects a bear's face in an image, rotates and extracts the face, creates an ``embedding'' for the face, and uses the embedding to classify the individual. We trained and tested the application using labeled images of 132 known individuals collected from British Columbia, Canada, and Alaska, USA. Based on 4,674 images, with an 80/20\% split for training and testing, respectively, we achieved a facial detection (ability to find a face) average precision of 0.98 and an individual classification (ability to identify the individual) accuracy of 83.9\%. BearID and its annotated source code provide a replicable methodology for applying deep learning methods of facial recognition applicable to many other species that lack distinguishing markings. Further analyses of performance should focus on the influence of certain parameters on recognition accuracy, such as age and body size. Combining BearID with camera trapping could facilitate fine-scale behavioral research such as individual spatiotemporal activity patterns, and a cost-effective method of population monitoring through mark\textendash recapture studies, with implications for species and landscape conservation and management. Applications to practical conservation include identifying problem individuals in human\textendash wildlife conflicts, and evaluating the intrapopulation variation in efficacy of conservation strategies, such as wildlife crossings.},

They are used to test for evidence that the distribution underlying recent deployment data differs from that underlying the historical reference data. Often, however, various factors such as time-induced correlation mean that batches of recent deployment data are not expected to form an i.i.d. sample from the historical data distribution. Instead we may wish to test for differences in the distributions conditional on context that is permitted to change. To facilitate this we borrow machinery from the causal inference domain to develop a more general drift detection framework built upon a foundation of two-sample tests for conditional distributional treatment effects. We recommend a particular instantiation of the framework based on maximum conditional mean discrepancies. We then provide an empirical study demonstrating its effectiveness for various drift detection problems of practical interest, such as detecting drift in the distributions underlying subpopulations of data in a manner that is insensitive to their respective prevalences. The study additionally demonstrates applicability to ImageNet-scale vision problems.},

Surprisingly, we find that choosing the right training label granularity provides a much larger performance boost than choosing the best WSOL algorithm. We also show that changing the label granularity can significantly improve data efficiency.},

By looking through the lenses of data quantity, data domain, data quality, and task granularity, we provide new insights into the necessary conditions for successful selfsupervised learning. Our key findings include observations such as: (i) the benefit of additional pretraining data beyond 500k images is modest, (ii) adding pretraining images from another domain does not lead to more general representations, (iii) corrupted pretraining images have a disparate impact on supervised and self-supervised pretraining, and (iv) contrastive learning lags far behind supervised learning on fine-grained visual classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia exhibit the most complex alliances known outside of humans. Advances in our understanding of these alliances have occurred with expansions of our study area each decade. In the 1980s, we discovered that males cooperated in stable trios and pairs (first-order alliances) to herd individual oestrous females, and that two such alliances of four to six, sometimes related, individuals (second-order alliances) cooperated against other males in contests over females. The 1990s saw the discovery of a large 14-member second-order alliance whose members exhibited labile first-order alliance formation among nonrelatives. Partner preferences as well as a relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate in this `super-alliance' indicated differentiated relationships. The contrast between the super-alliance and the 1980s alliances suggested two alliance tactics. An expansion of the study area in the 2000s revealed a continuum of second-order alliance sizes in an open social network and no simple relationship between second-order alliance size and alliance stability, but generalized the relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate within second-order alliances. Association preferences and contests involving three second-order alliances indicated the presence of third-order alliances. Second-order alliances may persist for 20 years with stability thwarted by gradual attrition, but underlying flexibility is indicated by observations of individuals joining other alliances, including old males joining young or old second-order alliances. The dolphin research has informed us on the evolution of complex social relationships and large brain evolution in mammals and the ecology of alliance formation. Variation in odontocete brain size and the large radiation of delphinids into a range of habitats holds great promise that further effort to describe their societies will be rewarded with similar advances in our understanding of these important issues.},

  abstract = {Estimating the abundance of long-lived, migratory animals is challenging but essential for managing populations. We provide the first abundance estimates of endangered humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae from their breeding grounds in Oceania, South Pacific. Using fluke photo-identification (1999-2004, n = 660 individuals) and microsatellite genotypes (1999-2005, n = 840 individuals), we estimated abundance with open capture-recapture statistical models. Total Oceania abundance and trends were estimated from 4 primary and 5 secondary sampling sites across the region. Sex-specific genotype data enabled us to account for the difference in capturability of males and females, by doubling male-specific estimates of abundance derived from genotypes. Abundance estimates were congruent between primary- and secondary-region data sets, suggesting that the primary regions are representative of all Oceania. The best estimate of total abundance was 4329 whales (3345-5313) in 2005, from a sex-specific POPAN super-population model, which includes resident whales and those migrating through the surveyed areas. A doubled-male POPAN abundance estimate from 2003 (n = 2941, 95\% CI = 1648-4234) was considered the most plausible for the 4 primary survey areas and was similar to the 2003 doubled-male estimate derived from Pradel capture probabilities (n = 2952, 95\% CI = 2043-4325). Our results confirm that Oceania is the least abundant humpback whale breeding population in the southern hemisphere. Pradel models showed no significant trend in abundance, which contradicts the recovery seen in most other populations throughout the world. Thus we suggest that the whales in this area warrant continued study and management attention.},

A promising formulation is domain-invariant learning, which identifies the key issue of learning which features are domain-specific versus domaininvariant. An important assumption in this area is that the training examples are partitioned into ``domains'' or ``environments''. Our focus is on the more common setting where such partitions are not provided. We propose EIIL, a general framework for domain-invariant learning that incorporates Environment Inference to directly infer partitions that are maximally informative for downstream Invariant Learning. We show that EIIL outperforms invariant learning methods on the CMNIST benchmark without using environment labels, and significantly outperforms ERM on worst-group performance in the Waterbirds and CivilComments datasets. Finally, we establish connections between EIIL and algorithmic fairness, which enables EIIL to improve accuracy and calibration in a fair prediction problem.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing visibility of fine-grained recognition in our field, ``fine-grained'' has thus far lacked a precise definition. In this work, building upon clustering theory, we pursue a framework for measuring dataset granularity. We argue that dataset granularity should depend not only on the data samples and their labels, but also on the distance function we choose. We propose an axiomatic framework to capture desired properties for a dataset granularity measure and provide examples of measures that satisfy these properties. We assess each measure via experiments on datasets with hierarchical labels of varying granularity. When measuring granularity in commonly used datasets with our measure, we find that certain datasets that are widely considered fine-grained in fact contain subsets of considerable size that are substantially more coarse-grained than datasets generally regarded as coarse-grained. We also investigate the interplay between dataset granularity with a variety of factors and find that fine-grained datasets are more difficult to learn from, more difficult to transfer to, more difficult to perform few-shot learning with, and more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a largescale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 5001000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

Not only is this method extremely easy to implement, but we also demonstrate that it can be used in conjunction with existing forms of data augmentation and other regularizers to further improve model performance. We evaluate this method by applying it to current state-of-the-art architectures on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, yielding new state-of-the-art results of 2.56\%, 15.20\%, and 1.30\% test error respectively.

Unlike other verification problems, it needs to model minute but critical details between genuine and forged signatures, because a skilled falsification might only differ from a real signature by some specific kinds of deformation. This verification task is even harder in writer independent scenarios which is undeniably fiscal for realistic cases. In this paper, we model an offline writer independent signature verification task with a convolutional Siamese network. Siamese networks are twin networks with shared weights, which can be trained to learn a feature space where similar observations are placed in proximity. This is achieved by exposing the network to a pair of similar and dissimilar observations and minimizing the Euclidean distance between similar pairs while simultaneously maximizing it between dissimilar pairs. Experiments conducted on cross-domain datasets emphasize the capability of our network to handle forgery in different languages (scripts) and handwriting styles. Moreover, our designed Siamese network, named SigNet, provided better results than the state-of-the-art results on most of the benchmark signature datasets.},

However, extracting and matching such attributes remains an extremely challenging task due to high variability and deformability of clothing items. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained learning model and multimedia retrieval framework to address this problem. First, an attribute vocabulary is constructed using human annotations obtained on a novel finegrained clothing dataset. This vocabulary is then used to train a fine-grained visual recognition system for clothing styles. We report benchmark recognition and retrieval results on Women's Fashion Coat Dataset and illustrate potential mobile applications for attribute-based multimedia retrieval of clothing items and image annotation.},

  abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

  abstract = {1. Monitoring spatial and temporal patterns in cetacean abundance involves a variety of approaches depending upon the target species and the resources available. As a first step, the collection of incidental sightings or strandings information aids the construction of a species list and a rough measure of status and seasonal variation in abundance. These often make use of networks of volunteer observers although the wide variation in abilities and experience means that special attention must be paid to training and to data quality control. More robust monitoring of numbers requires quantification of effort and some correction for factors that influence detectability, such as sea state. 2. The presence of cetaceans may be recorded visually, or indirectly by acoustics. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and their applicability may vary between species. The use of fixed stations tends to allow sustained monitoring at relatively low cost but coverage is limited to the immediate vicinity. For more extensive coverage, mobile platforms are necessary. Platforms of opportunity such as ferries, whale-watching boats, etc. are often used to survey areas at low cost. These may allow repeat observations to be made over time, but with no control over where the vessel goes, it is typically not possible to sample wide areas, thus limiting abundance estimation. 3. Line transect surveys using dedicated platforms allow representative coverage of areas from which abundance estimates can be made (either using indices or absolute measures derived from density estimation). Assumptions relating to detectability and responsiveness need to be addressed and various methods (such as two-platform surveys) have been developed to accommodate these. 4. For some cetacean species, mark-recapture methods can be applied using photo-identification of recognizable individuals. Again, a number of assumptions are made, particularly relating to recognizability, representativeness of sampling and capture probabilities. Capturing, on film, as many animals in the population as possible helps to reduce the problem of heterogeneity of capture probabilities. Mark-recapture methods require at least two sampling occasions. If multiple sampling is employed, either open or closed population models can be used. 5. Measuring population change represents a particular challenge for mobile animals such as cetaceans. Changes in ranging patterns may have a large impact on abundance estimates unless very large areas are adequately covered. Power analysis is a useful method to indicate the ability of the data to detect a trend of a given magnitude. Increasingly, spatial modelling using GLMs and GAMs is being used to provide a better understanding of the biotic and hydrographic factors influencing cetacean distribution.},

Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models. To facilitate future research, we release all the code and billion-scale models.},

Many compact face recognition networks are thus proposed to resolve this problem, and triplet loss is effective to further improve the performance of these compact models. However, it normally employs a fixed margin to all the samples, which neglects the informative similarity structures between different identities. In this paper, we borrow the idea of knowledge distillation and define the informative similarity as the transferred knowledge. Then, we propose an enhanced version of triplet loss, named triplet distillation, which exploits the capability of a teacher model to transfer the similarity information to a student model by adaptively varying the margin between positive and negative pairs. Experiments on the LFW, AgeDB and CPLFW datasets show the merits of our method compared to the original triplet loss.},

Using a large dataset of photographs taken over a 31-year period, we evaluate the reliability, rate of change and demographic trends in different mark types on northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) in the Endangered Scotian Shelf population, and assess the prevalence and severity of anthropogenically caused markings. Only fin notches and back indentations were stable over long timescales, leading to 48\% of the overall population being assessed as reliably marked. Males and mature males were found to have higher incidence of most mark types compared to females and juveniles. The proportion of reliably marked individuals increased over time, a trend that should be accounted for in any temporal analysis of population size using mark-recapture methods. An overall increase in marked individuals may reflect the accumulation of scars on an aging population post whaling. Anthropogenic markings, including probable entanglement and propeller-vessel strike scars, occurred at a steady rate over the study period and were observed on 6.6\% of the population. The annual gain rate for all injuries associated with anthropogenic interactions was over 5 times the annual potential biological removal (PBR) calculated for the endangered population. As entanglement incidents and propeller-vessel strike injuries are typically undetected in offshore areas, we provide the first minimum estimate of harmful human interactions for northern bottlenose whales. With low observer effort for fisheries across the Canadian Atlantic, photo-identification offers an important line of evidence of the risks faced by this Endangered whale population.},

Most of the tour operators are based in Vava'u archipelago which represents an important breeding ground for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This study represents an assessment of the effects of swimmer approaches on humpback whales' behaviour using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAV flights took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons from onboard research and swim-with-whales vessels. Whales' behavioural states (resting, travelling, surface-active, socialising, nurturing) were assessed from aerial videos and the proportions of time spent in each state in the presence and absence of swimmers were compared. Whale agonistic behaviours directed towards swimmers and the injury of a swimmer caused by a whale were documented. Results indicate that in-water tourism activities significantly altered the time spent in each behavioural state by humpback whale in Vava'u. Mother-calf pairs decreased the proportion of time spent nurturing, while the time spent travelling increased two-fold when approached by swimmers.

  abstract = {In today's heavily overparameterized models, the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization -- including a generalization bound that we prove here -- we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-\{10, 100\}, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels.},

The results of a shipboard line-transect survey conducted in July-November 1991 (``summer'') were compared to those from aerial line-transect surveys conducted in March-April 1991 and February-April 1992 (``winter''). Using a confidence-interval-based bootstrap procedure, abundance estimates for six of the eleven species included in the comparison exhibited significant ({$\alpha$}= 0.05) differences between the winter and summer surveys. Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), common dolphins (Delphinus spp.), and northern right whale dolphins (Lissodelphis borealis) were significantly more abundant in winter. The abundance of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculuss) and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) reflected well-documented migratory patterns. Fin whales (B. physalus) were significantly more abundant during summer. No significant differences in seasonal abundance were identified for Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Significant north/south shifts in distribution were found for Dall's porpoises, common dolphins, and Pacific white-sided dolphins, and significant inshore/offshore differences were identified for northern right whale dolphins and humpback whales.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs \textendash extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {In this paper we publish the largest identity-annotated Holstein-Friesian cattle dataset Cows2021 and a first self-supervision framework for video identification of individual animals. The dataset contains 10,402 RGB images with labels for localisation and identity as well as 301 videos from the same herd. The data shows top-down in-barn imagery, which captures the breed's individually distinctive black and white coat pattern. Motivated by the labelling burden involved in constructing visual cattle identification systems, we propose exploiting the temporal coat pattern appearance across videos as a self-supervision signal for animal identity learning. Using an individual-agnostic cattle detector that yields oriented bounding-boxes, rotation-normalised tracklets of individuals are formed via tracking-by-detection and enriched via augmentations. This produces a `positive' sample set per tracklet, which is paired against a `negative' set sampled from random cattle of other videos. Frame-triplet contrastive learning is then employed to construct a metric latent space. The fitting of a Gaussian Mixture Model to this space yields a cattle identity classifier. Results show an accuracy of Top-1 57.0\% and Top-4: 76.9\% and an Adjusted Rand Index: 0.53 compared to the ground truth. Whilst supervised training surpasses this benchmark by a large margin, we conclude that self-supervision can nevertheless play a highly effective role in speeding up labelling efforts when initially constructing supervision information. We provide all data and full source code alongside an analysis and evaluation of the system.},

Convolutional Neural Network is a special type of DNN consisting of several convolution layers, each followed by an activation function and a pooling layer. The pooling layer is an important layer that executes the down-sampling on the feature maps coming from the previous layer and produces new feature maps with a condensed resolution. This layer drastically reduces the spatial dimension of input. It serves two main purposes. The first is to reduce the number of parameters or weights, thus lessening the computational cost. The second is to control the overfitting of the network. An ideal pooling method is expected to extract only useful information and discard irrelevant details. There are a lot of methods for the implementation of pooling operation in Deep Neural Networks. In this paper, we reviewed some of the famous and useful pooling methods.},

  abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins encountered around the Irish coast are considered part of a wide-ranging coastal community; however, knowledge on the significance of the north of Ireland for this species is limited by a lack of dedicated effort. Through social media, the opportunity now exists to gather large volumes of citizen science data in the form of high-quality images, potentially extending the spatial and temporal scope of photo-identification studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate social media as a data resource for photo-identification studies and to provide a preliminary assessment of bottlenose dolphins in the north of Ireland. Specifically, the study sought to examine the photo-identification data for spatial clustering. The study identified 54 well-marked individuals and provided evidence of potential year-round occurrence, with successful re-sightings throughout the study period (2007\textendash 2016). There was a geographic concentration of re-sightings along the north of Ireland, suggestive of interannual site fidelity. These results provide scientific rationale for strategically targeting the north of Ireland in future research on the Irish coastal community. For effective conservation of the bottlenose dolphin it is imperative that scientific research, and resultant management objectives, consider wide-ranging communities such as the Irish coastal community. Our research highlights data collection via social media as a cost-effective and scientifically valuable tool in the photo-identification of coastal cetaceans. We recommend that this method is used in research on low-density and wide-ranging coastal cetaceans.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in aerial drones offer new insights into the biology, ecology and behaviour of marine wildlife found on or near the ocean's surface. While opening up new opportunities for enhanced wildlife monitoring, the impacts of drone sampling and how it might influence interpretations of animal behaviour are only just beginning to be understood. The capacity of drones to record bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) behaviour was investigated, along with how the presence of a small drone at varying altitudes influences dolphin behaviour. Over 3 years and eight locations, 361 drone flights were completed between altitudes of 5 and 60 m above the ocean. Analyses showed that dolphins were increasingly likely to change behaviour with decreasing drone altitude. A positive correlation was also found between time spent hovering above a group of dolphins and the probability of recording a behavioural response. Dolphin group size also influenced the frequency of an observed behavioural change, displaying a positive correlation between behaviour change and group size. Overall, although drones have the potential to impact coastal dolphins when flown at low altitudes, they represent a useful tool for collecting ecological information on coastal dolphins owing to their convenience, low cost and capacity to observe behaviours underwater. To maximize benefits and minimize impacts, this study suggests that drones should be flown 30 m above coastal bottlenose dolphins.},

  abstract = {Online A/B testing evaluates the impact of a new technology by running it in a real production environment and testing its performance on a subset of the users of the platform. It is a well-known practice to run a preliminary offline evaluation on historical data to iterate faster on new ideas, and to detect poor policies in order to avoid losing money or breaking the system. For such offline evaluations, we are interested in methods that can compute offline an estimate of the potential uplift of performance generated by a new technology. Offline performance can be measured using estimators known as counterfactual or off-policy estimators. Traditional counterfactual estimators, such as capped importance sampling or normalised importance sampling, exhibit unsatisfying bias-variance compromises when experimenting on personalized product recommendation systems. To overcome this issue, we model the bias incurred by these estimators rather than bound it in the worst case, which leads us to propose a new counterfactual estimator. We provide a benchmark of the different estimators showing their correlation with business metrics observed by running online A/B tests on a large-scale commercial recommender system.},

Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

  abstract = {In addition to the threats of habitat loss and degradation, adult males of the Asian elephant Elephas maximus also face greater threats from ivory poaching and conflict with humans. To understand the impact of these threats, conservationists need robust estimates of abundance and vital rates specifically for the adult male segment of elephant populations. By integrating the identification of individual male elephants in a population from distinct morphology and natural markings, with modern capture\textendash recapture (CR) sampling designs, it is possible to estimate various demographic parameters that are otherwise difficult to obtain from this long-lived and wide-ranging megaherbivore. In this study, we developed systematic individual identification protocols and integrated them into CR sampling designs to obtain capture histories and thereby estimate the abundance of adult bull elephants in a globally important population in southern India. We validated these estimates against those obtained from an independent method combining line-transect density estimates with age\textendash sex composition data for elephants. The sampled population was open to gains and losses between sampling occasions. The abundance of adult males in the 176 km2 study area was {\^N}(S\^E{\^N}) = 134(14.20) and they comprised 14\% ({$\pm$}1\%) of the total elephant population. Time-specific abundance estimates for each sampling occasion showed a distinct increase in adult male numbers over the sampling period, explained by seasonal patterns of local migration. CR-based estimates for adult male abundance closely matched estimates from distance-based methods. Thus, while providing abundance data of comparable rigour and precision, photographic CR methods permit estimation of demographic parameters for the Asian elephant that are both urgently needed and difficult to obtain.},

While these new platforms are increasing the size and availability of imagery datasets, established photogrammetry methods require considerable manual input, allowing individual bias in techniques to influence measurements, increasing error and magnifying the time required to apply these techniques. Here, we introduce the next generation of photogrammetry methods utilizing a convolutional neural network to demonstrate the potential of a deep learning-based photogrammetry system for automatic species identification and measurement. We then present the same data analysed using conventional techniques to validate our automatic methods. Our results compare favorably across both techniques, correctly predicting whale species with 98\% accuracy (57/58) for humpback whales, minke whales, and blue whales. Ninety percent of automated length measurements were within 5\% of manual measurements, providing sufficient resolution to inform morphometric studies and establish size classes of whales automatically. The results of this study indicate that deep learning techniques applied to survey programs that collect large archives of imagery may help researchers and managers move quickly past analytical bottlenecks and provide more time for abundance estimation, distributional research, and ecological assessments.},

Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm.

Such identification is useful for biological studies of population, social interaction, migration, etc. The process whereby fin outlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually intensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time consuming and visually fatiguing. This research aims to develop automated methods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing techniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable threshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding, a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures ("pixelarity") in an image after thresholding. The metric indicates how cleanly a threshold segments background and foreground elements and hence provides a good measure of the quality of a given threshold. This research results in successful extractions in roughly 93\% of images, and significantly reduces user-input time.},

  abstract = {The European Union (EU) Habitats Directive requires Member States to monitor and maintain at favourable conservation status those species identified to be in need of protection, including all cetaceans. In July 2005 we surveyed the entire EU Atlantic continental shelf to generate robust estimates of abundance for harbour porpoise and other cetacean species. The survey used line transect sampling methods and purpose built data collection equipment designed to minimise bias in estimates of abundance. Shipboard transects covered 19,725km in sea conditions {$\leqslant$}Beaufort 4 in an area of 1,005,743km2. Aerial transects covered 15,802km in good/moderate conditions ({$\leqslant$}Beaufort 3) in an area of 364,371km2. Thirteen cetacean species were recorded; abundance was estimated for harbour porpoise (375,358; CV=0.197), bottlenose dolphin (16,485; CV=0.422), white-beaked dolphin (16,536; CV=0.303), short-beaked common dolphin (56,221; CV=0.234) and minke whale (18,958; CV=0.347). Abundance in 2005 was similar to that estimated in July 1994 for harbour porpoise, white-beaked dolphin and minke whale in a comparable area. However, model-based density surfaces showed a marked difference in harbour porpoise distribution between 1994 and 2005. Our results allow EU Member States to discharge their responsibilities under the Habitats Directive and inform other international organisations concerning the assessment of conservation status of cetaceans and the impact of bycatch at a large spatial scale. The lack of evidence for a change in harbour porpoise abundance in EU waters as a whole does not exclude the possibility of an impact of bycatch in some areas. Monitoring bycatch and estimation of abundance continue to be essential.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to fishery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We first give an ``entry-level'' introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.},

We build on recent work that uses convolutional neural networks to classify category-independent region proposals (R-CNN [16]), introducing a novel architecture tailored for SDS. We then use category-specific, topdown figure-ground predictions to refine our bottom-up proposals. We show a 7 point boost (16\% relative) over our baselines on SDS, a 5 point boost (10\% relative) over state-of-the-art on semantic segmentation, and state-of-the-art performance in object detection.

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities.

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

The survey includes a formulation of the backpropagation neural network architecture to make it a valid neural network and a proof that the backpropagation mean squared error function exists and is differentiable. Also included in the survey is a theorem showing that any L2 function can be implemented to any desired degree of accuracy with a three-layer backpropagation neural network. An appendix presents a speculative neurophysiological model illustrating the way in which the backpropagation neural network architecture might plausibly be implemented in the mammalian brain for corticocortical learning between nearby regions of cerebral cortex. One of the crucial decisions in the design of the backpropagation architecture is the selection of a sigmoidal activation function.},

The person reidentification subfield is no exception to this. Unfortunately, a prevailing belief in the community seems to be that the triplet loss is inferior to using surrogate losses (classification, verification) followed by a separate metric learning step. We show that, for models trained from scratch as well as pretrained ones, using a variant of the triplet loss to perform end-to-end deep metric learning outperforms most other published methods by a large margin.},

Static tags, freeze branding, paint marking, natural marks, and sonic tags are discussed. Emphasis is placed on radio tags. Three radio tracking systems and four types of radio transmitter attachments currently available for large cetaceans are evaluated and discussed. Results of a feasibility study using a VHF radio tracking system on bowhead whales are presented. On 20 and 21 August 1981 radio tags were deployed on two bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the eastern Beaufort Sea (69\textordmasculine 54'N x 132\textdegree 12'W). From one whale, signals were received intermittently for 10 min, the other, for one and one-half hours. Reliable dive-surface profiles of tagged whales from these transmissions were not possible. However, dive-surface profiles are reported for a bowhead whale identifiable by natural marks. Efforts to relocate tagged whales from ship and three aerial receiving stations were unsuccessful. Aerial surveys were flown from 20 July through 12 September, initially to locate whales but ultimately to relocate and track tagged animals. Efforts to relocate tagged whales continued from 16 September through 13 October in collaboration with a BLM (Bureau of Land Management) bowhead survey team working in OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) lease-sale areas. A brief radio transmission was received during one of these surveys but the presence of a tagged whale was unconfirmed by either further transmission or visual relocation. A record of all species of marine mammals sighted on surveys is presented. The development of a satellite-linked transmitter and requirements for a successful satellite tracking program are discussed.},

  abstract = {Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) in Western Australia have recently been used to study the population dynamics of the local whale shark aggregation. Because nascent research efforts at other aggregation points look to NMP as a model, further analysis of existing modeling approaches is important. We have expanded upon previous studies of NMP whale sharks by estimating CMR survival and recruitment rates as functions of average total length (TL). Our analysis suggests a decline in reported values of TL coincident with marginally increasing abundance among sharks sighted in more than one year (`returning') from 1995 to 2008. We found a positive, average returning recruitment rate ({$\lambda$}) of 1.07 yr\textendash 1 (0.99 to 1.15, 95\% CI); smaller individuals contributed in larger numbers to recruitment, allowing for population growth accompanied by a decline in median size. We subsequently explored intraseasonal population dynamics with the Open Robust Design (ORD) model structure. Our best-fit model estimated modestly increasing annual abundances between 107 (95\% CI = 90 to 124) and 159 (95\% CI = 127 to 190) for 2004 to 2007, suggesting a short-term increase in total annual abundance. The ORD also estimated an average residency time of 33 d (95\% CI = 31 to 39) and biweekly entry profiles into the study area. Overall, our techniques demonstrate how large aggregations of the species can be modeled to better understand short- and long-term population trends. These results also show the direct scientific benefit from the development of an online, collaborative data management system to increase collection of sighting data for a rare species in conjunction with ecotourism activity.},

The main contribution of the reinterpretation is in providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing and extending the algorithm. We show that the proposed framework suffers from several issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior related to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due to singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational Gaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that the algorithm still works only because the variational formulation annuls some of the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL) divergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of high-dimensional distributions. We show that motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit. Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically and on a simple practical example which shows that the QKLoptimal approximation of a full rank Gaussian with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal Component Analysis solution.},

In this paper, a high accurate deep learning based dolphin identification algorithm is proposed. We presented an advanced approach, called hybrid saliency method, for feature extraction and efficiently integrate several well-known techniques to make dolphins distinguishable. With the proposed techniques, we can avoid the background part (e.g. the sea water) to affect the identification results, which is usually a problem of most convolutional neural network based methods. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can well identify a dolphin in most cases and it can achieve the accuracy rate of 85\% even if there are 40 dolphins to be distinguished.},

  abstract = {End-to-end paradigms significantly improve the accuracy of various deep-learning-based computer vision models. To this end, tasks like object detection have been upgraded by replacing non-end-to-end components, such as removing non-maximum suppression by training with a set loss based on bipartite matching. However, such an upgrade is not applicable to instance segmentation, due to its significantly higher output dimensions compared to object detection. In this paper, we propose an instance segmentation Transformer, termed ISTR, which is the first end-to-end framework of its kind. ISTR predicts low-dimensional mask embeddings, and matches them with ground truth mask embeddings for the set loss. Besides, ISTR concurrently conducts detection and segmentation with a recurrent refinement strategy, which provides a new way to achieve instance segmentation compared to the existing top-down and bottom-up frameworks. Benefiting from the proposed endto-end mechanism, ISTR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance even with approximation-based suboptimal embeddings. Specifically, ISTR obtains a 46.8/38.6 box/mask AP using ResNet50-FPN, and a 48.1/39.9 box/mask AP using ResNet101-FPN, on the MS COCO dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results reveal the promising potential of ISTR as a solid baseline for instance-level recognition. Code has been made available at: https://github. com/hujiecpp/ISTR.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

  abstract = {Recently, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) has achieved marvelous accomplishment in object detection and recognition. In this paper, Faster R-CNN is applied to marine organisms detection and recognition. However, the training of Faster R-CNN requires a mass of labeled samples which are difficult to obtain for marine organisms. Therefore, three data augmentation methods dedicated to underwater-imaging are proposed. Specifically, the inverse process of underwater image restoration is used to simulate different marine turbulence environments. Perspective transformation is proposed to simulate different views of camera shooting. Illumination synthesis is used to simulate different marine uneven illuminating environments. The performance of each data augmentation method, together with previous frequently used data augmentation methods are evaluated by Faster R-CNN on the real-world underwater dataset, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for marine organisms detection and recognition.},

  abstract = {Cross-domain person re-identification (re-ID) is challenging due to the bias between training and testing domains. We observe that if backgrounds in the training and testing datasets are very different, it dramatically introduces difficulties to extract robust pedestrian features, and thus compromises the cross-domain person re-ID performance. In this paper, we formulate such problems as a background shift problem. A Suppression of Background Shift Generative Adversarial Network (SBSGAN) is proposed to generate images with suppressed backgrounds. Unlike simply removing backgrounds using binary masks, SBSGAN allows the generator to decide whether pixels should be preserved or suppressed to reduce segmentation errors caused by noisy foreground masks. Additionally, we take ID-related cues, such as vehicles and companions into consideration. With high-quality generated images, a Densely Associated 2-Stream (DA-2S) network is introduced with Inter Stream Densely Connection (ISDC) modules to strengthen the complementarity of the generated data and ID-related cues. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on three re-ID datasets, i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03, under the crossdomain person re-ID scenario.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4\% and 17.4\% respectively.},

We propose a computer vision photo ID system and report recognition results over a database of thousands of unconstrained fin images. To the best of our knowledge this line of work establishes the first fully automated contour-based visual ID system in the field of animal biometrics. The approach put forward appreciates shark fins as textureless, flexible and partially occluded objects with an individually characteristic shape. In order to recover animal identities from an image we first introduce an open contour stroke model, which extends multi-scale region segmentation to achieve robust fin detection. Secondly, we show that combinatorial, scale-space selective fingerprinting can successfully encode fin individuality. We then measure the species-specific distribution of visual individuality along the fin contour via an embedding into a global `fin space'. Exploiting this domain, we finally propose a non-linear model for individual animal recognition and combine all approaches into a fine-grained multi-instance framework. We provide a system evaluation, compare results to prior work, and report performance and properties in detail.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

In this paper, we show how pre-trained convolutional image features can be used to assist scientists in discovering interesting chemical clusters for further investigation. Our method reduces the dimensionality of raw fluorescent stained images from a high throughput imaging (HTI) screen, producing an embedding space that groups together images with similar cellular phenotypes. Running standard unsupervised clustering on this embedding space yields a set of distinct phenotypic clusters. This allows scientists to further select and focus on interesting clusters for downstream analyses. We validate the consistency of our embedding space qualitatively with t-sne visualizations, and quantitatively by measuring embedding variance among images that are known to be similar. Results suggested the usefulness of our proposed workflow using deep learning and clustering and it can lead to robust HTI screening and compound triage.},

  abstract = {Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation algorithm. In this work we present \textbackslash emph\{Population Based Training (PBT)\}, a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ocean is experiencing unprecedented rapid change, and visually monitoring marine biota at the spatiotemporal scales needed for responsible stewardship is a formidable task. As baselines are sought by the research community, the volume and rate of this required data collection rapidly outpaces our abilities to process and analyze them. Recent advances in machine learning enables fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data, but have had limited success in the ocean due to lack of data standardization, insufficient formatting, and demand for large, labeled datasets. To address this need, we built FathomNet, an open-source image database that standardizes and aggregates expertly curated labeled data. FathomNet has been seeded with existing iconic and non-iconic imagery of marine animals, underwater equipment, debris, and other concepts, and allows for future contributions from distributed data sources. We demonstrate how FathomNet data can be used to train and deploy models on other institutional video to reduce annotation effort, and enable automated tracking of underwater concepts when integrated with robotic vehicles. As FathomNet continues to grow and incorporate more labeled data from the community, we can accelerate the processing of visual data to achieve a healthy and sustainable global ocean.},

  abstract = {Camera-based electronic monitoring (EM) systems are increasingly being deployed onboard commercial fishing vessels to collect essential data for fisheries management and regulation. These systems generate large quantities of video data which must be reviewed on land by human experts. Computer vision can assist this process by automatically detecting and classifying fish species, however the lack of existing public data in this domain has hindered progress. To address this, we present the Fishnet Open Images Database, a large dataset of EM imagery for fish detection and fine-grained categorization onboard commercial fishing vessels. The dataset consists of 86,029 images containing 34 object classes, making it the largest and most diverse public dataset of fisheries EM imagery to-date. It includes many of the characteristic challenges of EM data: visual similarity between species, skewed class distributions, harsh weather conditions, and chaotic crew activity. We evaluate the performance of existing detection and classification algorithms and demonstrate that the dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for development of computer vision algorithms in fisheries. The dataset is available at https://www.fishnet.ai/.},

To bring the potential impact of photo-ID data within reach of a greater number of research groups, we introduce an R-based photo-ID project management system, named `catRlog'. As a computer directory with custom apps embedded throughout, catRlog serves as a workflow organizer that simplifies, streamlines, and improves the quality of photo-ID data processing. The system can be utilized by research teams in a number of ways, ranging from automated formatting and printing of a photo-ID catalog, to photoID matching, thereby creating and expanding a historical catalog, to processing of identification data to generate datasets necessary for site fidelity, mark\textendash recapture, and social association analyses. As an R-based tool, the apps are open-source, cross-platform, readily customizable, and easily updated. catRlog has been tested using photo-ID databases of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) within a mainland fjord system of Pacific Canada, but is a generalized system useful for almost any photo-ID project of any species in any habitat. A detailed user's manual and example dataset are provided.},

  abstract = {There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model \textendash{} uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive \textendash{} often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.},

  abstract = {The only known predictable aggregation of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata subsp.) occurs in the Australian offshore waters of the northern Great Barrier Reef in May-August each year. The identification of individual whales is required for research on the whales' population characteristics and for monitoring the potential impacts of tourism activities, including commercial swims with the whales. At present, it is not cost-effective for researchers to manually process and analyze the tens of thousands of underwater images collated after each observation/tourist season, and a large data base of historical non-identified imagery exists. This study reports the first proof of concept for recognizing individual dwarf minke whales using the Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).The ``off-the-shelf'' Image net-trained VGG16 CNN was used as the feature-encoder of the per-pixel sematic segmentation Automatic Minke Whale Recognizer (AMWR). The most frequently photographed whale in a sample of 76 individual whales (MW1020) was identified in 179 images out of the total 1320 images provided. Training and image augmentation procedures were developed to compensate for the small number of available images. The trained AMWR achieved 93\% prediction accuracy on the testing subset of 36 positive/MW1020 and 228 negative/not-MW1020 images, where each negative image contained at least one of the other 75 whales. Furthermore on the test subset, AMWR achieved 74\% precision, 80\% recall, and 4\% false-positive rate, making the presented approach comparable or better to other state-of-the-art individual animal recognition results.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis, and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6 fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM, which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods. Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.},

It is proven that a weight decay has two effects in a linear network. First, it suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vector by choosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem. Second, if the size is chosen right, a weight decay can suppress some of the effects of static noise on the targets, which improves generalization quite a lot. It is then shown how to extend these results to networks with hidden layers and non-linear units. Finally the theory is confirmed by some numerical simulations using the data from NetTalk.},

Estimates of temporal variance independent of sampling error, calculated from the survival estimates, indicated constant survival in the Upper St. Johns River, true temporal variability in the Northwest and Atlantic Coast, and large sampling variability obscuring estimates for the Southwest. Calf and subadult survival probabilities were estimated for the Upper St. Johns River from the only available data for known-aged individuals: 0.810 (95\% CI 0.727\textendash 0.873) for 1st year calves, 0.915 (0.827\textendash 0.960) for 2nd year calves, and 0.969 (0.946\textendash 0.982) for manatee 3 yr or older. These estimates of survival probabilities and temporal variance, in conjunction with estimates of reproduction probabilities from photoidentification data can be used to model manatee population dynamics, estimate population growth rates, and provide an integrated measure of regional status.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

  abstract = {Automatic tracking and classification are essential for studying the behaviors of wild animals. Owing to dynamic far-shooting photos, the occlusion problem, protective coloration, the background noise is irregular interference for designing a computerized algorithm for reducing human labeling resources. Moreover, wild dolphin images are hard-acquired by on-the-spot investigations, which takes a lot of waiting time and hardly sets the fixed camera to automatic monitoring dolphins on the ocean in several days. It is challenging tasks to detect well and classify a dolphin from polluted photos by a single famous deep learning method in a small dataset. Therefore, in this study, we propose a generic Cascade Small Object Detection (CSOD) algorithm for dolphin detection to handle small object problems and develop visualization to backbone based classification (V2BC) for removing noise, highlighting features of dolphin and classifying the name of dolphin. The architecture of CSOD consists of the P-net and the F-net. The P-net uses the crude Yolov3 detector to be a core network to predict all the regions of interest (ROIs) at lower resolution images. Then, the F-net, which is more robust, is applied to capture the ROIs from high-resolution photos to solve single detector problems. Moreover, a visualization to backbone based classification (V2BC) method focuses on extracting significant regions of occluded dolphin and design significant post-processing by referencing the backbone of dolphins to facilitate for classification. Compared to the state of the art methods, including faster-rcnn, yolov3 detection and Alexnet, the Vgg, and the Resnet classification. All experiments show that the proposed algorithm based on CSOD and V2BC has an excellent performance in dolphin detection and classification. Consequently, compared to the related works of classification, the accuracy of the proposed designation is over 14\% higher. Moreover, our proposed CSOD detection system has 42\% higher performance than that of the original Yolov3 architecture.},

  abstract = {Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks.},

  abstract = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods are often built on pixel-level localization maps obtained from a classifier. However, training on class labels only, classifiers suffer from the spurious correlation between foreground and background cues (e.g. train and rail), fundamentally bounding the performance of WSSS. There have been previous endeavors to address this issue with additional supervision. We propose a novel source of information to distinguish foreground from the background: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, or images devoid of foreground object classes. In particular, we utilize the hard OoDs that the classifier is likely to make false-positive predictions. These samples typically carry key visual features on the background (e.g. rail) that the classifiers often confuse as foreground (e.g. train), so these cues let classifiers correctly suppress spurious background cues. Acquiring such hard OoDs does not require an extensive amount of annotation efforts; it only incurs a few additional image-level labeling costs on top of the original efforts to collect class labels. We propose a method, W-OoD, for utilizing the hard OoDs. W-OoD achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012. The code is available at: https://github.com/naver-ai/w-ood.},

Some key components in DINO are extended for segmentation through a shared architecture and training process. Mask DINO is simple, efficient, and scalable, and it can benefit from joint large-scale detection and segmentation datasets.

  abstract = {The YOLO community has been in high spirits since our first two releases! By the advent of Chinese New Year 2023, which sees the Year of the Rabbit, we refurnish YOLOv6 with numerous novel enhancements on the network architecture and the training scheme. This release is identified as YOLOv6 v3.0. For a glimpse of performance, our YOLOv6-N hits 37.5\% AP on the COCO dataset at a throughput of 1187 FPS tested with an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. YOLOv6-S strikes 45.0\% AP at 484 FPS, outperforming other mainstream detectors at the same scale (YOLOv5-S, YOLOv8-S, YOLOX-S and PPYOLOE-S). Whereas, YOLOv6-M/L also achieve better accuracy performance (50.0\%/52.8\% respectively) than other detectors at a similar inference speed. Additionally, with an extended backbone and neck design, our YOLOv6-L6 achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy in real-time. Extensive experiments are carefully conducted to validate the effectiveness of each improving component. Our code is made available at https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6.},

  abstract = {The brain processes information through many layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron's axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.},

Additionally, we propose an efficient Bottleneck-LSTM layer that significantly reduces computational cost compared to regular LSTMs. Our network achieves temporal awareness by using Bottleneck-LSTMs to refine and propagate feature maps across frames. This approach is substantially faster than existing detection methods in video, outperforming the fastest single-frame models in model size and computational cost while attaining accuracy comparable to much more expensive single-frame models on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset. Our model reaches a real-time inference speed of up to 15 FPS on a mobile CPU.},

Because of the imbalance between positive and negative samples, we trained classification networks based on block. We selected the classification network with the hightest accuracy. The selected classification network was used as the backbone of the image segmentation network-Mask R-CNN, which performs excellently on natural images. Lastly, Mask R-CNN model trained on the COCO data set was fine-tuned to segment pulmonary nodules. The model was tested on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.},

  abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300\textbackslash times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500\textbackslash times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO testdev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-theart by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

  abstract = {Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pretraining method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\texttimes 1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixelsto-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ``fully convolutional'' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [19], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [4] to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural network (ANN) is widely used in pattern recognition related area. In some case, the computational load is very heavy, in other case, real time process is required. So there is a need to apply a parallel algorithm on it, and usually the computation for ANN is inherently parallel. In this paper, graphic hardware is used to speed up the computation of ANN. In recent years, graphic processing unit (GPU) grows faster than CPU. Graphic hardware venders provide programmability on GPU. In this paper, application of commodity available GPU for two kinds of ANN models was explored. One is the self-organizing maps (SOM); the other is multi layer perceptron (MLP). The computation result shows that ANN computing on GPU is much faster than on standard CPU when the neural network is large. And some design rules for improve the efficiency on GPU are given.},

  abstract = {Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is an important computer vision problem which has gained increasing attention due to its academic and commercial potential. Although different kinds of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, it still remains challenging due to factors like abrupt appearance changes and severe object occlusions. In this work, we contribute the first comprehensive and most recent review on this problem. We inspect the recent advances in various aspects and propose some interesting directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any extensive review on this topic in the community. We endeavor to provide a thorough review on the development of this problem in recent decades. The main contributions of this review are fourfold: 1) Key aspects in a multiple object tracking system, including formulation, categorization, key principles, evaluation of an MOT are discussed. 2) Instead of enumerating individual works, we discuss existing approaches according to various aspects, in each of which methods are divided into different groups and each group is discussed in detail for the principles, advances and drawbacks. 3) We examine experiments of existing publications and summarize results on popular datasets to provide quantitative comparisons. We also point to some interesting discoveries by analyzing these results. 4) We provide a discussion about issues of MOT research, as well as some interesting directions which could possibly become potential research effort in the future.},

Estimates of its abundance are available in a few regions, details of its distribution are lacking, and its status in the Mediterranean Sea is ranked as Data Deficient by the IUCN Red List. In this paper, a synergy between bio-ecological analysis and innovative strategies has been applied to construct a digital platform, DolFin. It contains a collection of sighting data and geo-referred photos of Grampus griseus, acquired from 2013 to 2016 in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, North-eastern Central Mediterranean Sea), and the first automated tool for Smart Photo Identification of the Risso's dolphin (SPIR). This approach provides the capability to collect and analyse significant amounts of data acquired over wide areas and extended periods of time. This effort establishes the baseline for future large-scale studies, essential to providing further information on the distribution of G. griseus. Our data and analysis results corroborate the hypothesis of a resident Risso's dolphin population in the Gulf of Taranto, showing site fidelity in a relatively restricted area characterized by a steep slope to around 800\,m in depth, north of the Taranto Valley canyon system.},

Face recognition is widely used in schools, hospitals, and companies as an attendance system, even as a criminal watchlist examination system. Thus, face recognition implementation is difficult to obtain the identity of people who are wearing masks, and moreover, computer systems might fail to detect the faces. This study used Haar-cascade Face detection and MobileNet while proposing the addition of the cosine distance method. This method compares the middle position of face detection results within the previous frame and the current. The proposed system can generate a person's name and identification number while wearing a mask. The system is designed to utilize multi-threading by comparing the transfer learning methods of VGG16 and Triplet Loss FaceNet for face mask recognition with an accuracy rate of 100\% and 82.20\%. Real-time implementation speed resulted in 4 FPS and 22 FPS and successfully added cosine distance to generate a person's ID number.},

A benchmark is obtained by defining corresponding classification tasks and evaluation protocols, and baseline results are presented. The construction of this dataset was made possible by the work of aircraft enthusiasts, a strategy that can extend to the study of number of other object classes. Compared to the domains usually considered in fine-grained visual classification (FGVC), for example animals, aircraft are rigid and hence less deformable.

Nonetheless, the actual longevity and reliability of each mark type has never been assessed. In this paper, we used photographs to investigate the etiology of skin marks in the species, analyze their distribution and temporal variability, and discuss implications for photo identification. Nineteen mark types were described on the dorsal fin of Risso's dolphin, including 2 new to the literature: the snake-like mark and the protruding fat. Longevity of skin marks ranged from 6 years for the protruding fat to several decades for scrapes and dots. Persistent and reliable marks were notch, tooth-rake, and thick single and parallel scrapes. Mark change was sufficiently low that all mark types could be used for photo identification, provided that backlit or underexposed images were discarded as photographs taken under suboptimal light conditions proved to be unreliable. Finally, mark distribution and variability were unequal between age classes; juveniles were less marked and showed a higher rate of mark change than older individuals so that, even if they possessed enough notches to be classified as reliably marked, they could be confidently matched over a time interval of up to 3 years.},

In this paper, we propose finding matching and non-matching pairs of images by representing them with neural network based feature vectors, whose similarity is measured by Euclidean distance. The feature vectors are obtained with convolutional neural networks which are learnt from labeled examples of matching and non-matching image pairs by using a contrastive loss function in a Siamese network architecture. Previously Siamese architecture has been utilised in facial image verification and in matching local image patches, but not yet in generic image retrieval or whole-image matching. Our experimental results show that the proposed features improve matching performance compared to baseline features obtained with networks which are trained for image classification task. The features generalize well and improve matching of images of new landmarks which are not seen at training time. This is despite the fact that the labeling of matching and non-matching pairs is imperfect in our training data. The results are promising considering image retrieval applications, and there is potential for further improvement by utilising more training image pairs with more accurate ground truth labels.},

These clear physical changes undoubtedly affect marine ecosystems. Species dependent on sea ice, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the ringed seal (Phoca hispida), provide the clearest examples of sensitivity to climate change. Responses of cetaceans to climate change are more difficult to discern, but in the eastern North Pacific evidence is emerging that gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are delaying their southbound migration, expanding their feeding range along the migration route and northward to Arctic waters, and even remaining in polar waters over winter\textemdash all indications that North Pacific and Arctic ecosystems are in transition.

Morphological variation has been well-described for a number of cetacean species, including the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). In this study we analyzed dorsal fin morphometric variation in coastal bottlenose dolphins to search for geographic patterns at different spatial scales. A total of 533 dorsal fin images from 19 available photo-identification catalogs across the three Mexican oceanic regions (Pacific Ocean n = 6, Gulf of California n = 6 and, Gulf of Mexico n = 7) were used in the analysis. Eleven fin shape measurements were analyzed to evaluate fin polymorphism through multivariate tests. Principal Component Analysis on log-transformed standardized ratios explained 94\% of the variance. Canonical Discriminant Function Analysis on factor scores showed separation among most study areas (p {$<$} 0.05) with exception of the Gulf of Mexico where a strong morphometric cline was found. Possible explanations for the observed differences are related to environmental, biological and evolutionary processes. Shape distinction between dorsal fins from the Pacific and those from the Gulf of California were consistent with previously reported differences in skull morphometrics and genetics. Although the functional advantages of dorsal fin shape remains to be assessed, it is not unlikely that over a wide range of environments, fin shape may represent a trade-off among thermoregulatory capacity, hydrodynamic performance and the swimming/hunting behavior of the species.},

Because this process can in many cases not be done by machines, labeling needs to be performed by human domain experts. This process tends to be expensive both in time and money, and is prone to errors. Additionally, reviewing an entire labeled dataset manually is often prohibitively costly, so many real world datasets contain mislabeled instances.To address this issue, we present in this paper a non-parametric end-to-end pipeline to find mislabeled instances in numerical, image and natural language datasets. We evaluate our system quantitatively by adding a small number of label noise to 29 datasets, and show that we find mislabeled instances with an average precision of more than 0.84 when reviewing our system's top 1\% recommendation. We then apply our system to publicly available datasets and find mislabeled instances in CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, and others. Finally, we publish the code and an applicable implementation of our approach.},

  abstract = {The long and unconstrained nature of egocentric videos makes it imperative to use temporal segmentation as an important preprocessing step for many higher-level inference tasks. Activities of the wearer in an egocentric video typically span over hours and are often separated by slow, gradual changes. Furthermore, the change of camera viewpoint due to the wearer's head motion causes frequent and extreme, but, spurious scene changes. The continuous nature of boundaries makes it difficult to apply traditional Markov Random Field (MRF) pipelines relying on temporal discontinuity, whereas deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks gather context only upto a few hundred frames, rendering them ineffective for egocentric videos. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised temporal segmentation technique especially suited for day-long egocentric videos. We formulate the problem as detecting concept drift in a time-varying, non i.i.d. sequence of frames. Statistically bounded thresholds are calculated to detect concept drift between two temporally adjacent multivariate data segments with different underlying distributions while establishing guarantees on false positives. Since the derived threshold indicates confidence in the prediction, it can also be used to control the granularity of the output segmentation. Using our technique, we report significantly improved state of the art f-measure for daylong egocentric video datasets, as well as photostream datasets derived {${_\ast}$}The work was done during the internship with Prof. Chetan Arora.},

Existing traditional systems, due to dependency on time-consuming and cost-intensive field surveying, do not provide a scalable way to decipher warnings and assess the precise extent of the risk at a hyper-local level. In this work, machine learning was used to automate the process of identifying dwellings and their type to build a potentially more effective disaster vulnerability assessment system. First, satellite imageries of low-income settlements and vulnerable areas in India were used to identify 7 different dwelling types. Specifically, we formulated the dwelling type classification as a semantic segmentation task and trained a U-net based neural network model, namely TernausNet, with the data we collected. Then a risk score assessment model was employed, using the determined dwelling type along with an inundation model of the regions. The entire pipeline was deployed to multiple locations prior to natural hazards in India in 2020. Post hoc ground-truth data from those regions was collected to validate the efficacy of this model which showed promising performance. This work can aid disaster response organizations and communities at risk by providing household-level risk information that can inform preemptive actions.},

The method based mainly on an advanced technique for instance segmentation (Mask RCNN) which has been shown very efficient in segmentation task on COCO dataset. However, Mask R-CNN has some limitations. It works on still images, so cannot explore temporal information of the object of interest such as dynamic hand gestures. Second Mask R-CNN usually fails to detect object suffered from motion blur at low resolution as hand. Our proposed method improves Mask R-CNN by integrating a Mean Shift tracker that tracks hands in consecutive frames and removes false alarms. We have also trained another model of Mask R-CNN on cropped regions extended from hand centers to obtain a better accuracy of segmentation. We have evaluated both methods on a self-constructed multi-view dataset of hand gestures and show how robust these methods are to view point changes. Experimental results showed that our method achieved better performance than the original Mask R-CNN under different viewpoints.},

Most existing methods detect ships by using a rectangular bounding box but do not perform segmentation down to the pixel level. This paper proposes a ship detection and segmentation method based on an improved Mask R-CNN model. Our proposed method can accurately detect and segment ships at the pixel level. By adding a bottom-up structure to the FPN structure of Mask R-CNN, the path between the lower layers and the topmost layer is shortened, allowing the lower layer features to be more effectively utilized at the top layer. In the bottom-up structure, we use channel-wise attention to assign weights in each channel and use the spatial attention mechanism to assign a corresponding weight at each pixel in the feature maps. This allows the feature maps to respond better to the target's features. Using our method, the detection and segmentation mAPs increased from 70.6\% and 62.0\% to 76.1\% and 65.8\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Deep learning algorithms have been proven to be a powerful tool in image and video processing for security and surveillance operations. In a maritime environment, the fusion of electro-optical sensor data with human intelligence plays an important role to counter the security issues. For instance, the situational awareness can be enhanced through an automated system that generates reports on ship identity and signature together with detecting the changes on naval vessels activity. To date, various studies have been set out to explore the performance of deep neural networks using a ship signature database. In the current study, we investigate the Mask R-CNN method to address not only the naval vessel detection using bounding boxes, but also obtaining their segmentation masks. We train and validate the model on data captured by an on-board camera covering the visible spectral band under various weather and light conditions. The experimental results show that Mask RCNN provides high confidence scores on challenging scenarios with a mean average precision of 86.4\%. However, the precision of the segmentation mask is slightly deteriorated when the ships are adjacent to the border of the captured scene. Moreover, the network tested on thermal images indicates a decrease in detection and segmentation performance since the training data distribution is not representative enough.},

We apply the trained network to each proposal in an input image, and construct the final semantic segmentation map by combining the results from all proposals in a simple manner. The proposed algorithm mitigates the limitations of the existing methods based on fully convolutional networks by integrating deep deconvolution network and proposal-wise prediction; our segmentation method typically identifies detailed structures and handles objects in multiple scales naturally.

  abstract = {Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would improve our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ``big data'' sciences. Motion-sensor ``camera traps'' enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with {$>$}93.8\% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3\% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6\% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving {$>$}8.4 y (i.e., {$>$}17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity conservation depends on accurate, up-to-date information about wildlife population distributions. Motion-activated cameras, also known as camera traps, are a critical tool for population surveys, as they are cheap and non-intrusive. However, extracting useful information from camera trap images is a cumbersome process: a typical camera trap survey may produce millions of images that require slow, expensive manual review. Consequently, critical information is often lost due to resource limitations, and critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Computer vision is poised to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys, and recent studies have harnessed deep learning techniques for automatic information extraction from camera trap images. However, the accuracy of results depends on the amount, quality, and diversity of the data available to train models, and the literature has focused on projects with millions of relevant, labeled training images. Many camera trap projects do not have a large set of labeled images and hence cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even projects that do have labeled data from similar ecosystems have struggled to adopt deep learning methods because image classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e., camera locations). In this paper, we focus not on automating the labeling of camera trap images, but on accelerating this process. We combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence to build a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system to minimize the manual work required to identify and count animals in camera trap images. Our proposed scheme can match the state of the art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labeling effort by over 99.5\%.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of learning self-supervised representations from unlabeled image collections. Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional self-supervised training and transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Vision-language models such as CLIP are pretrained on large volumes of internet sourced image and text pairs, and have been shown to sometimes exhibit impressive zero- and low-shot image classification performance. However, due to their size, finetuning these models on new datasets can be prohibitively expensive, both in terms of the supervision and compute required. To combat this, a series of light-weight adaptation methods have been proposed to efficiently adapt such models when limited supervision is available. In this work, we show that while effective on internet-style datasets, even those remedies under-deliver on classification tasks with images that differ significantly from those commonly found online. To address this issue, we present a new approach called SVL-Adapter that combines the complementary strengths of both vision-language pretraining and self-supervised representation learning. We report an average classification accuracy improvement of 10\% in the low-shot setting when compared to existing methods, on a set of challenging visual classification tasks. Further, we present a fully automatic way of selecting an important blending hyperparameter for our model that does not require any held-out labeled validation data.

Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation. The results show that Multi Layer Perceptrons outperform all the eight methods used as a benchmark in this study.},

By continuously gathering and matching images, it is possible to monitor and track individuals across location and time. However, matching images manually is a tedious and time-consuming task. To automate the process, we propose a pipeline based on finding and matching keypoints between image pairs. We evaluate our pipeline with four different keypoint descriptors, namely ORB, SIFT, RootSIFT, and SuperPoint, and demonstrate that the number of matching keypoints between a pair of images is a strong indicator for the likelihood that they contain the same individual. The best results are obtained with RootSIFT, which achieves an mAP of 75.91\% on our test dataset (TinyMola+) without training or fine-tuning any parts of the pipeline. Furthermore, we show that the pipeline generalizes to other domains, such as re-identification of seals and cows. Lastly, we discuss the impracticality of a ranking-based output for real-life tasks and propose an alternative approach by viewing re-identification as a binary classification. We show that the pipeline can be easily modified with minimal fine-tuning to provide a binary output with a precision of 98\% and recall of 44\% on the TinyMola+ dataset, which basically eliminates the need for time-consuming manual verification on nearly half the dataset.},

This is a very challenging task for which, apart from an accurate object detector that is able to deal with cluttered scenes with many objects, partially occluded and with bad illumination, additional information is needed to determine the leading player. Therefore, we propose a leading player detector method combining the Mask R-CNN object detector and spatiotemporal interest points, referred to as MR-CNN+STIPs. The performance of the proposed leading player detector is evaluated on a custom sports video dataset acquired during handball training lessons.

Examples range from detecting lesions on functional magnetic resonance images, to the detection of tumours in histopathological images and extracting quantitative single-cell information from microscopy imagery, where cell segmentation is a major bottleneck. Attention-based transformers are state-of-the-art in a range of deep learning fields. They have recently been proposed for segmentation tasks where they are beginning to outperform other methods. We present a novel attention-based cell detection transformer (CellDETR) for direct end-to-end instance segmentation. While the segmentation performance is on par with a state-of-the-art instance segmentation method, Cell-DETR is simpler and faster. We showcase the method's contribution in a the typical use case of segmenting yeast in microstructured environments, commonly employed in systems or synthetic biology. For the specific use case, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art tools for semantic segmentation and additionally predicts the individual object instances. The fast and accurate instance segmentation performance increases the experimental information yield for a posteriori data processing and makes online monitoring of experiments and closed-loop optimal experimental design feasible.

Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

For this, precisely segmenting each cattle image from its background is a prerequisite, which is an important step towards obtaining real-time individual cattle information. In this paper, an instance segmentation approach based on a Mask R-CNN deep learning framework is proposed to solve cattle instance segmentation and contour extraction problems in a real feedlot environment. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: key frame extraction (detect the huge cattle motion frames), image enhancement (reduce the illumination and shadow influence), cattle segmentation and body contour extraction. We trained and tested the proposed approach on a challenging cattle image dataset. According to the experimental results, the proposed approach can render fairly desirable cattle segmentation performance with 0.92 Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA) and achieve contour extraction with an Average Distance Error (ADE) of 33.56 pixel, which is better than that of the state-of-the-art SharpMask and DeepMask instance segmentation methods.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are powerful tools for research and monitoring of wildlife. However, the effects of these systems on most marine mammals are largely unknown, preventing the establishment of guidelines that will minimize animal disturbance. In this study, we evaluated the behavioral responses of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) to small multi-rotor UAS flight. From 2015 to 2017, we piloted 211 flights using DJI quadcopters (Phantom II Vision +, 3 Professional and 4) to approach and follow animals over shallow-water habitats in Belize. The quadcopters were equipped with high-resolution cameras to observe dolphins during 138 of these flights, and manatees during 73 flights. Aerial video observations of animal behavior were coded and paired with flight data to determine whether animal activity and/or the UAS's flight patterns caused behavioral changes in exposed animals. Dolphins responded to UAS flight at altitudes of 11\textendash 30 m, and responded primarily when they were alone or in small groups. Single dolphins and one pair responded to the UAS by orienting upward and turning towards the aircraft to observe it, before quickly returning to their pre-response activity. A higher number of manatees responded to the UAS, exhibiting strong disturbance in response to the aircraft from 6\textendash 104 m. Manatees changed their behavior by fleeing the area and sometimes this elicited the same response in nearby animals. If pursued post-response, manatees repeatedly responded to overhead flight by evading the aircraft's path. These findings suggest that the invasiveness of UAS varies across individuals, species, and taxa. We conclude that careful exploratory research is needed to determine the impact of multi-rotor UAS flight on diverse species, and to develop best practices aimed at reducing the disturbance to wildlife that may result from their use.},

Deep learning methods for computer vision in particular show good performance on a variety of tasks; animal detection and classification using deep learning networks are widely used to assist ecological studies. A related challenge is tracking animal movement over multiple cameras. For effective animal movement tracking, it is necessary to distinguish between individuals of the same species to correctly identify an individual moving between two cameras. Such problems could potentially be solved through animal re-identification methods. In this paper, the applicability of existing animal re-identification techniques for fully automated individual animal tracking in a cross-camera setup is explored. Recent developments in animal re-identification in the context of open-set recognition of individuals, and the extension of these systems to multiple species is examined. Some of the best performing human re-identification and object tracking systems are also reviewed in view of extending ideas within them to individual animal tracking. The survey concludes by presenting common trends in re-identification methods, lists a few challenges in the domain and recommends possible solutions.},

In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

Juvenile green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata turtles were manually caught at Arvoredo Island, southern Brazil, and through visual comparison of facial profile photographs we were able to identify recaptured individuals with 2, 1, or no artificial tags. Additionally, Bayesian inference based on tag loss information indicated that the way a tag is attached (position and distance from the flipper edge) affects significantly the probability of its loss. We encourage the use of photographic identification (facial profile) as a reliable method for individual recognition in studies of cheloniid turtles.},

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

  abstract = {Photo-identification is a commonly used non-invasive technique that has been profitably employed in biological studies throughout the years. It starts from the assumption that a single individual can be recognized in multiple photos captured at different times by exploiting its unique representative and visible physical qualities such as marks, notches or any other definite feature. Hence, photo-identification is performed to infer knowledge about wild species' spatial and temporal distributions as well as population dynamics, thus providing valuable information especially when the species being investigated is ranked as data deficient. Furthermore, the technological improvements of the last decades and the large availability of devices with powerful computing capabilities are driving the research towards a common goal of enriching bio-ecological studies with innovative computer science approaches. In this scenario, computer vision plays a fundamental role, as it can successfully assist researchers in the analysis of large amounts of data. The aim of this paper is, in fact, to effectively provide a computer vision approach for the photo-identification of the Risso's dolphin, exploiting specific visual cues with a feature-based approach relying on SIFT and SURF feature detectors. The experiments have been conducted on image data acquired in the Gulf of Taranto from 2013 to 2017, conducting a comparative analysis of the performance of both SIFT and SURF, as well as a comparison with the state-of-the-art software DARWIN, and they proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach and suggested its application would be suitable to large scale studies. In conclusion, this paper shows an innovative computer vision application for the identification of unknown Risso's dolphin individuals that relies on a feature-based automated approach. The results suggest that the proposed approach can efficiently assist researchers during the photo-identification task of large amounts of data collected in such a challenging domain.},

Consequently, this shape vector is converted into the masks' contour points using a fast numerical transform. Compared to previous methods, we introduce a new training technique, where we utilize a differentiable shape decoder, which manages the automatic weight balancing of the shape vector's coefficients. We used the Fourier series as a shape encoder because of its coefficient interpretability and fast implementation. FourierNet shows promising results compared to polygon representation methods, achieving 30.6 mAP on the MS COCO 2017 benchmark. At lower image resolutions, it runs at 26.6 FPS with 24.3 mAP. It reaches 23.3 mAP using just eight parameters to represent the mask (note that at least four parameters are needed for bounding box prediction only). Qualitative analysis shows that suppressing a reasonable proportion of higher frequencies of Fourier series, still generates meaningful masks. These results validate our understanding that lower frequency components hold higher information for the segmentation task, and therefore, we can achieve a compressed representation.

Its implementation will prove crucial in predicting crop yield, forest damage, or more generally the impact on ecosystems services relevant for socio-economic functioning, which if absent can lead to humanitarian disasters. Vegetation status depends on weather and environmental conditions that modulate complex ecological processes taking place at several timescales. Interactions between vegetation and different environmental drivers express responses at instantaneous but also time-lagged effects, often showing an emerging spatial context at landscape and regional scales. We formulate the land surface forecasting task as a strongly guided video prediction task where the objective is to forecast the vegetation developing at very fine resolution using topography and weather variables to guide the prediction. We use a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) architecture to address this task and predict changes in the vegetation state in Africa using Sentinel-2 satellite NDVI, having ERA5 weather reanalysis, SMAP satellite measurements, and topography (DEM of SRTMv4.1) as variables to guide the prediction. Ours results highlight how ConvLSTM models can not only forecast the seasonal evolution of NDVI at high resolution, but also the differential impacts of weather anomalies over the baselines. The model is able to predict different vegetation types, even those with very high NDVI variability during target length, which is promising to support anticipatory actions in the context of drought-related disasters 1.},

  abstract = {Studies on differences in external morphology and pigmentation patterns were historically carried out using stranded individuals or opportunistic sightings; few studies have involved sampling systematically free-ranging individuals. In order to investigate and describe main pigmentation characteristics, outlining 'typical' regional pigmentations, this work analysed systematic photographic information taken on free-ranging striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba. Photographs of dolphins in the Ligurian Sea were collected between May 2004 and December 2006. All individuals were described by the presence/absence of pigmentation variables and by differences in colour shades. The frequency of all the pigmentation variables analysed is stable in the population (10 'gene' variables, 19 'allele' variables), and remains similar between each different group of dolphins. But population presents widespread pigmentation variability between specimens, allowing identification even at single individual level. Cluster analysis also found that the majority of the pigmentations derive from two main colour patterns, called 'mat' and 'pale' patterns (fmat = 0.68; fpale = 0.12). The Bray-Curtis index showed a high variability of the intra-group pigmentation distance between groups. This resulted in a positive correlation between group size and 'intra-group' pigmentation distance: the distance increases rapidly up to a group size of 40 individuals. According to the results obtained, the striped dolphins seem to be concentrated in small groups in which there is a large phenotypic similarity among individuals. These small units could be associated between them to form temporary large groups observed only in pelagic waters. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for ``border matting'' has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

  abstract = {1. Density estimation is of fundamental importance in wildlife management. The use of camera traps to estimate animal density has so far been restricted to capture-recapture analysis of species with individually identifiable markings. This study developed a method that eliminates the requirement for individual recognition of animals by modelling the underlying process of contact between animals and cameras. 2. The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to unbiased camera placement and accurate measurement of model parameters, this method opens the possibility of reduced labour costs for estimating wildlife density and may make estimation possible where it has not been previously. We provide guidelines on the trapping effort required to obtain reasonably precise estimates.}

  abstract = {The ability of a researcher to re-identify (re-ID) an individual animal upon re-encounter is fundamental for addressing a broad range of questions in the study of ecosystem function, community and population dynamics and behavioural ecology. Tagging animals during mark and recapture studies is the most common method for reliable animal re-ID; however, camera traps are a desirable alternative, requiring less labour, much less intrusion and prolonged and continuous monitoring into an environment. Despite these advantages, the analyses of camera traps and video for re-ID by humans are criticized for their biases related to human judgement and inconsistencies between analyses. In this review, we describe a brief history of camera traps for re-ID, present a collection of computer vision feature engineering methodologies previously used for animal re-ID, provide an introduction to the underlying mechanisms of deep learning relevant to animal re-ID, highlight the success of deep learning methods for human re-ID, describe the few ecological studies currently utilizing deep learning for camera trap analyses and our predictions for near future methodologies based on the rapid development of deep learning methods. For decades, ecologists with expertise in computer vision have successfully utilized feature engineering to extract meaningful features from camera trap images to improve the statistical rigor of individual comparisons and remove human bias from their camera trap analyses. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of deep learning systems which have demonstrated the accurate re-ID of humans based on image and video data with near perfect accuracy. Despite this success, ecologists have yet to utilize these approaches for animal re-ID. By utilizing novel deep learning methods for object detection and similarity comparisons, ecologists can extract animals from an image/video data and train deep learning classifiers to re-ID animal individuals beyond the capabilities of a human observer. This methodology will allow ecologists with camera/video trap data to reidentify individuals that exit and re-enter the camera frame. Our expectation is that this is just the beginning of a major trend that could stand to revolutionize the analysis of camera trap data and, ultimately, our approach to animal ecology.},

Recent state of the art methods such as HypViT move to more complex embedding spaces that may yield better results but are harder to scale to production environments. In this work, we first construct a simpler model based on triplet loss with hard negatives mining that performs at the state of the art level but does not have these drawbacks. Second, we introduce a novel approach for image retrieval postprocessing called Siamese Transformer for Image Retrieval (STIR) that reranks several top outputs in a single forward pass. Unlike previously proposed Reranking Transformers, STIR does not rely on global/local feature extraction and directly compares a query image and a retrieved candidate on pixel level with the usage of attention mechanism. The resulting approach defines a new state of the art on standard image retrieval datasets: Stanford Online Products and DeepFashion In-shop. We also release the source code1 and an interactive demo2 of our approach.},

Most bottlenose dolphins studied to date have had definable home ranges, and behavioral, morphological and biochemical information indicates discrete stocks in some areas. Bottlenose dolphins appear to form relatively permanent social groups based on sex and age. Mother-calf bonds are long-lasting. Movement patterns are extremely variable from location to location but are relatively predictable at any given site. Food resources are one of the most important factors affecting movements. Bottlenose dolphin behavior is very flexible, and these dolphins are generally active day and night. Feeding peaks in the morning and afternoon have been observed at several sites. Social behavior is an important component of daily activities. Sharks are the most significant predator on bottlenose dolphins in most areas, but captive and wild studies show that dolphins and sharks frequently live in harmony as well. Human activities may be helpful, harmful or neutral to bottlenose dolphins, but interactions with humans are frequent for these coastal cetaceans.},

A photographic match was found to an adult female in the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue. The whale's previous last sighting, on 24 September 2008 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, implies movement to the Azores of at least 3,320km in 101 days. It was subsequently resighted in the Bay of Fundy on 2 September 2009, 237 days after being seen in the Azores. This appears to be the only documented evidence of a western North Atlantic right whale outside its normal range in winter, and provides additional evidence of the potential for interbreeding between western North Atlantic right whales and the remnant eastern population.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers.

The manual annotation of objects in large image sets is tedious and unreliable. Therefore, a weakly supervised learning approach is desirable, where the training set needs only binary labels regarding whether an image contains the target object class. In the weakly supervised approach a detector is used to iteratively annotate the training set and learn the object model. We present a novel weakly supervised learning framework for learning an object detector. Our framework incorporates a new initial annotation model to start the iterative learning of a detector and a model drift detection method that is able to detect and stop the iterative learning when the detector starts to drift away from the objects of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging PASCAL 2007 dataset.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

Parties contained an average of 4.8 individuals, but party size and composition were unstable. While these temporary parties often contained both males and females, long term consistent associations generally were between members of the same sex. The highest association coefficients, resulting from very frequent co-occurrence within parties were between males and between mothers and offspring. Males formed subgroups of two or three individuals who consistently associated with each other, and these were stable over periods of at least seven years in some cases. Male subgroups preferentially associated with particular other male subgroups. Females associated most consistently with other females, although not to the same extent as some males. Female associations were better described as a network rather than discrete subgroups. Male-female associations were generally inconsistent and depended in part on female reproductive state. Mothers and their offspring associated very consistently for at least 4 years.},

  abstract = {There are mainly two types of state-of-the-art object detectors. On one hand, we have two-stage detectors, such as Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) or Mask R-CNN, that (i) use a Region Proposal Network to generate regions of interests in the first stage and (ii) send the region proposals down the pipeline for object classification and bounding-box regression. Such models reach the highest accuracy rates, but are typically slower. On the other hand, we have single-stage detectors, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Singe Shot MultiBox Detector), that treat object detection as a simple regression problem by taking an input image and learning the class probabilities and bounding box coordinates. Such models reach lower accuracy rates, but are much faster than two-stage object detectors. In this paper, we propose to use an image difficulty predictor to achieve an optimal tradeoff between accuracy and speed in object detection. The image difficulty predictor is applied on the test images to split them into easy versus hard images. Once separated, the easy images are sent to the faster single-stage detector, while the hard images are sent to the more accurate two-stage detector. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that using image difficulty compares favorably to a random split of the images. Our method is flexible, in that it allows to choose a desired threshold for splitting the images into easy versus hard.},

  abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

Various types of neural networks (UNet, Attention UNet, ReLayNet, LFUNet) were tested for semantic segmentation, their effectiveness was assessed using the Dice coefficient and compared to the graph theory techniques. Improvement in segmentation efficiency was achieved through the use of relative distance maps. We also show that selecting a larger kernel size for convolutional layers can improve segmentation quality depending on the neural network model. In the case of PVC, we obtain the effectiveness reaching up to 96.35\%.

  abstract = {This paper provides a pair similarity optimization viewpoint on deep feature learning, aiming to maximize the within-class similarity sp and minimize the between-class similarity sn. We find a majority of loss functions, including the triplet loss and the softmax cross-entropy loss, embed sn and sp into similarity pairs and seek to reduce (sn - sp). Such an optimization manner is inflexible, because the penalty strength on every single similarity score is restricted to be equal. Our intuition is that if a similarity score deviates far from the optimum, it should be emphasized. To this end, we simply re-weight each similarity to highlight the less-optimized similarity scores. It results in a Circle loss, which is named due to its circular decision boundary. The Circle loss has a unified formula for two elemental deep feature learning paradigms, i.e., learning with class-level labels and pair-wise labels. Analytically, we show that the Circle loss offers a more flexible optimization approach towards a more definite convergence target, compared with the loss functions optimizing (sn - sp). Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of the Circle loss on a variety of deep feature learning tasks. On face recognition, person re-identification, as well as several finegrained image retrieval datasets, the achieved performance is on par with the state of the art.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10\texttimes{} or 100\texttimes? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pretraining) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-theart results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

  abstract = {Motion-activated cameras (``camera traps'') are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or ``out-of-distribution'' in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98\% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82\% accuracy and correctly identified 94\% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.},

So far, detection and discrimination of oil spill and look-alike are still limited to the use of traditional machine learning algorithms and semantic segmentation deep learning models with limited accuracy. Thus, this study developed a novel deep learning oil spill detection model using computer vision instance segmentation Mask-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) model. The model training was conducted using transfer learning on the ResNet 101 on COCO as backbone in combination with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture for feature extraction at 30 epochs with 0.001 learning rate. Testing of the model was conducted using the least training and validation loss value on the withheld testing images. The model's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, specificity, IoU, F1-measure and overall accuracy values. Ship detection and segmentation had the highest performance with overall accuracy of 98.3\%. The model equally showed a higher accuracy for oil spill and look-alike detection and segmentation although oil spill detection outperformed look-alike with overall accuracy values of 96.6\% and 91.0\% respectively. The study concluded that the deep learning instance segmentation model performs better than conventional machine learning models and deep learning semantic segmentation models in detection and segmentation.},

  abstract = {The Baraka's whipray (Maculabatis ambigua) is a major constituent of small-scale fisheries catch in the south-western Indian Ocean. Despite this, little is known of its life-history or exploitation status. We provide the first estimates of crucial life-history parameters and the maximum intrinsic population growth rate rmax, using specimens collected from small-scale fisheries landings in Kenya, Zanzibar and Madagascar (with northern Madagascar representing a range extension for this species). We assess the relative risk of overexploitation by combining rmax with estimates of total Z, fishing F, and natural M mortality, and an estimate of the exploitation ratio E. The data indicate that Baraka's whipray is a medium-sized, fast-growing, early maturing species, with a relatively long lifespan. This results in a high rmax relative to many other elasmobranchs, which when combined with estimates of F suggests that the species is not at imminent risk of extinction. Yet, estimates of exploitation ratio E indicate likely overfishing for the species, with full recruitment to the fishery being post-maturation and exploitation occurring across a broad range of age and size classes. Thus, Baraka's whipray is unlikely to be biologically sustainable in the face of current fisheries pressures. This paper makes an important contribution to filling the gap in available data and is a step towards developing evidence-based fisheries management for this species. Further, it demonstrates a simple and widely applicable framework for assessment of data-poor elasmobranch exploitation status and extinction risk.},

  abstract = {The measurable impacts of small-scale fisheries on coastal marine ecosystems and vulnerable megafauna species (elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles) within them are largely unknown, particularly in developing countries. This study assesses megafauna catch and composition in handline, longline, bottom-set and drift gillnet fisheries of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Observers monitored 21 landing sites across Kenya, Zanzibar and northern Madagascar for 12 months in 2016\textendash 17. Landings (n = 4666) identified 59 species, including three sea turtles, two small cetaceans and one sirenian (Dugong dugon). Primary gear threats to investigated taxa were identified as bottom-set gillnets (marine mammals, sea turtles and batoids), drift gillnets (marine mammals, batoids and sharks) and longlines (sharks). Overall, catch was dominated by small and moderately sized coastal requiem sharks (Carcharhiniformes) and whiprays (Dasyatidae). Larger coastal and oceanic elasmobranchs were also recorded in substantial numbers as were a number of deeper-water species. The diversity of catch demonstrates the potential for small-scale fisheries to have impacts across a number of ecosystems. From the observed catch rates we calculated annual regional elasmobranch landings to be 35,445 (95\%CI 30,478\textendash 40,412) tonnes, 72.6\% more than officially reported in 2016 and 129.2\% more than the 10-year average (2006\textendash 16), constituting 2.48 (95\%CI 2.20\textendash 2.66) million individuals. Productivity-Susceptibility Analyses indicate that small and moderately sized elasmobranchs are most vulnerable in the small-scale fisheries. The study demonstrates substantial underreporting of catches in small-scale fisheries and highlights the need to expand efforts globally to assess the extent and impact of small-scale fisheries on vulnerable marine species and their respective ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Photographic identification is an essential research and management tool for marine mammal scientists. However, manual identification of individuals is time-consuming. To shorten processing times, we developed finFindR, an open-source application that uses a series of neural networks to autonomously locate dorsal fins in unedited field images, quantify an individual's unique fin characteristics, and match them to an existing photograph catalog. During a blind test comparing manual searching to finFindR for common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops Tursiops truncatus) photographs, experienced photo-identification technicians achieved similar match rates but examined an order of magnitude fewer photographs using finFindR (an average of 10 required with finFindR versus 124 with manual search). In those tests, the correct identity was ranked in the first position in 88\% of cases and was within the top 50 ranked positions in 97\% of cases. Our observations suggest that finFindR's matching capabilities are robust to moderate variation in image quality and fin distinctiveness. Importantly, finFindR allows users to build a catalog of known individuals through time and match an unlimited number of individuals instead of being restricted to a predefined set. finFindR's convolutional neural networks could be re-trained to identify members of many marine mammal species without altering finFindR's inherent structure.},

Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the predefined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7\% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS framework can serve as a simple and strong alternative for many other instance-level tasks. Code is available at:Code is available at: https://tinyurl.com/FCOSv1},

In order to analyze this data, the images are labeled manually by ecologists, where they identify species of animals and more fine-grained details, such as animal sex or age, or even individual animal identities. However, with the number of camera trap images quickly outgrowing the capacity of the labelers, ecologists are unable to keep up with the wealth of data they are obtaining. Using computer vision, we can automatically generate labels for new camera trap images at the rate that they are being obtained, allowing ecologists to uncover ecological and biological information at a scale previously not possible. In this paper, we explore computer vision approaches for species identification in camera trap images and for individual jaguar identification, both of which show promising results.

  abstract = {We introduce the Northumberland Dolphin Dataset 2020 (NDD20), a challenging image dataset annotated for both coarse and fine-grained instance segmentation and categorisation. This dataset, the first release of the NDD, was created in response to the rapid expansion of computer vision into conservation research and the production of field-deployable systems suited to extreme environmental conditions -- an area with few open source datasets. NDD20 contains a large collection of above and below water images of two different dolphin species for traditional coarse and fine-grained segmentation. All data contained in NDD20 was obtained via manual collection in the North Sea around the Northumberland coastline, UK. We present experimentation using standard deep learning network architecture trained using NDD20 and report baselines results.},

With the vast amount of data obtained it is crucially important to develop a system that is able to categorise this quickly. The Northumberland Dolphin Dataset (NDD) is an on-going novel dataset project made up of above and below water images of, and spectrograms of whistles from, white-beaked dolphins. These are produced by photo-id and PAM data collection methods applied off the coast of Northumberland, UK.

  abstract = {Monitoring the environment with acoustic sensors is now practical; sensors are sold as commercial devices, storage is cheap, and the field of ecoacoustics is recognized as an effective way to scale monitoring of the environment. However, a pressing challenge faced in many eScience projects is how to manage, analyze, and visualize very large data so that scientists can benefit, with ecoacoustic data presenting its own particular challenges.     This paper presents a new zoomable interactive visualization interface for the exploration of environmental audio data. The interface is a new tool in the Acoustic Workbench, an ecoacoustics software platform built for managing environmental audio data. This Google Maps like interface for audio data, enables zooming in and out of audio data by incorporating specialized, multiresolution, visual representations of audio data into the workbench website. The `zooming' visualization allows scientists to surface the structure, detail, and patterns in content that would otherwise be opaque to them, from scales of seconds through to weeks of data. The Ecosounds instance of the Acoustic Workbench contains 52 years (108 TB) of audio data, from 1016 locations, which results in a 180 million-tile, 8.3 terapixel visualization.   The design and implementation of this novel big audio data visualization is presented along with some design considerations for storing visualization tiles.},

  abstract = {Photographic-identification (photo-ID) of bottlenose dolphins using individually distinctive features on the dorsal fin is a well-established and useful tool for tracking individuals; however, this method can be labor-intensive, especially when dealing with large catalogs and/or infrequently surveyed populations. Computer vision algorithms have been developed that can find a fin in an image, characterize the features of the fin, and compare the fin to a catalog of known individuals to generate a ranking of potential matches based on dorsal fin similarity. We examined if and how researchers use computer vision systems in their photo-ID process and developed an experiment to evaluate the performance of the most commonly used, recently developed, systems to date using a long-term photo-ID database of known individuals curated by the Chicago Zoological Society's Sarasota Dolphin Research Program. Survey results obtained for the ``Rise of the machines \textendash{} Application of automated systems for matching dolphin dorsal fins: current status and future directions'' workshop held at the 2019 World Marine Mammal Conference indicated that most researchers still rely on manual methods for comparing unknown dorsal fin images to reference catalogs of known individuals. Experimental evaluation of the finFindR R application, as well as the CurvRank, CurvRank v2, and finFindR implementations in Flukebook suggest that high match rates can be achieved with these systems, with the highest match rates found when only good to excellent quality images of fins with average to high distinctiveness are included in the matching process: for the finFindR R application and the CurvRank and CurvRank v2 algorithms within Flukebook more than 98.92\% of correct matches were in the top 50-ranked positions, and more than 91.94\% of correct matches were returned in the first ranked~position. Our results offer the first comprehensive examination into the performance and accuracy of computer vision algorithms designed to assist with the photo-ID process of bottlenose dolphins and can be used to build trust by researchers hesitant to use these systems. Based on our findings and discussions from the ``Rise of the Machines'' workshop we provide recommendations for best practices for using computer vision systems for dorsal fin photo-ID.},

However, to date the vast majority of these approaches have restricted themselves to training on standard benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. We argue that fine-grained visual categorization problems, such as plant and animal species classification, provide an informative testbed for self-supervised learning. In order to facilitate progress in this area we present two new natural world visual classification datasets, iNat2021 and NeWT. The former consists of 2.7M images from 10k different species uploaded by users of the citizen science application iNaturalist. We designed the latter, NeWT, in collaboration with domain experts with the aim of benchmarking the performance of representation learning algorithms on a suite of challenging natural world binary classification tasks that go beyond standard species classification. These two new datasets allow us to explore questions related to large-scale representation and transfer learning in the context of finegrained categories. We provide a comprehensive analysis of feature extractors trained with and without supervision on ImageNet and iNat2021, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different learned features across a diverse set of tasks. We find that features produced by standard supervised methods still outperform those produced by self-supervised approaches such as SimCLR. However, improved self-supervised learning methods are constantly being released and the iNat2021 and NeWT datasets are a valuable resource for tracking their progress.},

Citizen scientists are clearly more capable at labeling fine-grained categories than MTurkers.

If the annotation task does not require much domain knowledge (such as part annotation), then MTurkers can perform on par with citizen scientists. Gathering fine-grained category labels with MTurk should be done with care, as we have shown that naive averaging of labels does not converge to the correct label. Finally, the cost savings of using citizen scientists can be significant when the number of annotation tasks grows.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

For cetaceans, this identification may be based on morphological characters observable from a boat such as shape, spots and cuts of the back, fluke and dorsal fins. However, for some species such as the sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), this approach may be challenging as individuals display a rather uniform skin pigmentation. They also do not very often show their fluke, complicating individual identification from a boat. Immature sperm whales that usually have an unharmed fluke may be excluded from photo-identification catalogues. Within the framework of the Maubydick project, focusing on the long-term monitoring of sperm-whales in Mauritius, passive underwater observation and video recording were used to identify long-lasting body markers (e.g. sex, ventral white markings, cut-outs of fins). A catalogue of 38 individuals (six adult males, 18 adult females and 14 immatures) enabled observers to record some nearly-daily, and yearly resightings.},

What is the effect of (a) domainspecific fine-tuning and (b) a special-purpose network architecture designed and trained specifically for the target domain? How do these approaches perform in one-class classification? We investigate these questions by tackling two biological object recognition tasks: classification of ``cryptic'' plants of genus Coprosma and identification of New Zealand moth species. We compare results based on out-of-the-box features extracted using a pre-trained state-of-the-art network to those obtained by finetuning to the target domain, and also evaluate features learned using a simple Siamese network trained only on data from the target domain. For each extracted feature set, we test a number of classifiers, e.g., support vector machines. In addition to multiclass classification, we also consider one-class classification, a scenario that is particularly relevant to biosecurity applications. In the multi-class setting, we find that out-of-the-box lowlevel features extracted from the generic pre-trained network yield high accuracy (90.76\%) when coupled with a simple LDA classifier. Fine-tuning improves accuracy only slightly (to 91.6\%). Interestingly, features extracted from the much simpler Siamese network trained on data from the target domain lead to comparable results (90.8\%). In the one-class classification setting, we note high variability in the area under the ROC curve across feature sets, opening up the possibility of considering an ensemble approach.},

  abstract = {Research on the application of vehicle re-identification to video surveillance has attracted increasingly growing attention. Existing methods are associated with the difficulties of distinguishing different instances of the same car model owing to the incapability of recognizing subtle differences among these instances and the possibility that a subtle difference may lead to incorrect results of ranking. In this paper, a discriminative fine-grained network for vehicle re-identification based on a two-stage re-ranking framework is proposed to address these issues. This discriminative fine-grained network (DFN) is composed of fine-grained and Siamese networks. The proposed hybrid network can extract discriminative features of the vehicle instances with subtle differences. The Siamese network is rather suitable for general object re-identification using two streams of the network, while the fine-grained network is capable of detecting subtle differences. The proposed two-stage re-ranking method allows obtaining a more reliable ranking list by using the Jaccard metric and merging the first and second re-ranking lists, where the latter list is formed using the sample mean feature. Experimental results on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets show that the proposed method achieves the superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods used in vehicle re-identification.},

Recent methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines to tackle this task. Here, we propose a new video instance segmentation framework built upon Transformers, termed VisTR, which views the VIS task as a direct end-to-end parallel sequence decoding/prediction problem. Given a video clip consisting of multiple image frames as input, VisTR outputs the sequence of masks for each instance in the video in order directly. At the core is a new, effective instance sequence matching and segmentation strategy, which supervises and segments instances at the sequence level as a whole. VisTR frames the instance segmentation and tracking in the same perspective of similarity learning, thus considerably simplifying the overall pipeline and is significantly different from existing approaches.},

  abstract = {We present a new, embarrassingly simple approach to instance segmentation in images. Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, it is the arbitrary number of instances that have made instance segmentation much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-thensegment' strategy as used by Mask R-CNN, or predict category masks first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the notion of "instance categories", which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the instance's location and size, thus nicely converting instance mask segmentation into a classification-solvable problem. Now instance segmentation is decomposed into two classification tasks. We demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework with strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming recent singleshot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.},

  abstract = {In this work, we aim at building a simple, direct, and fast instance segmentation framework with strong performance. We follow the principle of the SOLO method of Wang et al. "SOLO: segmenting objects by locations". Importantly, we take one step further by dynamically learning the mask head of the object segmenter such that the mask head is conditioned on the location. Specifically, the mask branch is decoupled into a mask kernel branch and mask feature branch, which are responsible for learning the convolution kernel and the convolved features respectively. Moreover, we propose Matrix NMS (non maximum suppression) to significantly reduce the inference time overhead due to NMS of masks. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate a simple direct instance segmentation system, outperforming a few state-of-the-art methods in both speed and accuracy. A light-weight version of SOLOv2 executes at 31.3 FPS and yields 37.1\% AP. Moreover, our state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask byproduct) and panoptic segmentation show the potential to serve as a new strong baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.

  abstract = {Masked image modeling (MIM) learns representations with remarkably good finetuning performances, overshadowing previous prevalent pre-training approaches such as image classification, instance contrastive learning, and image-text alignment. In this paper, we show that the inferior fine-tuning performance of these pre-training approaches can be significantly improved by a simple post-processing in the form of feature distillation (FD). The feature distillation converts the old representations to new representations that have a few desirable properties just like those representations produced by MIM. These properties, which we aggregately refer to as optimization friendliness, are identified and analyzed by a set of attention- and optimization-related diagnosis tools. With these properties, the new representations show strong fine-tuning performance. Specifically, the contrastive self-supervised learning methods are made as competitive in fine-tuning as the state-of-the-art masked image modeling (MIM) algorithms. The CLIP models' fine-tuning performance is also significantly improved, with a CLIP ViT-L model reaching 89.0\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification. On the 3-billion-parameter SwinV2G model, the fine-tuning accuracy is improved by +1.5 mIoU / +1.1 mAP to 61.4 mIoU / 64.2 mAP on ADE20K semantic segmentation and COCO object detection, respectively, creating new records on both benchmarks. More importantly, our work provides a way for the future research to focus more effort on the generality and scalability of the learnt representations without being pre-occupied with optimization friendliness since it can be enhanced rather easily.

The task of FGIA targets analyzing visual objects from subordinate categories, e.g., species of birds or models of cars. The small inter-class and large intra-class variation inherent to fine-grained image analysis makes it a challenging problem. Capitalizing on advances in deep learning, in recent years we have witnessed remarkable progress in deep learning powered FGIA. In this paper we present a systematic survey of these advances, where we attempt to re-define and broaden the field of FGIA by consolidating two fundamental fine-grained research areas \textendash{} fine-grained image recognition and fine-grained image retrieval. In addition, we also review other key issues of FGIA, such as publicly available benchmark datasets and related domain-specific applications. We conclude by highlighting several research directions and open problems which need further exploration from the community.},

Given the trailing edge from an unknown individual, we produce a ranking of known individuals from a database. The nicks and notches along the trailing edge define an individual's unique signature. We define a representation based on integral curvature that is robust to changes in viewpoint and pose, and captures the pattern of nicks and notches in a local neighborhood at multiple scales. We explore two ranking methods that use this representation. The first uses a dynamic programming time-warping algorithm to align two representations, and interprets the alignment cost as a measure of similarity. This algorithm also exploits learned spatial weights to downweight matches from regions of unstable curvature. The second interprets the representation as a feature descriptor. Feature keypoints are defined at the local extrema of the representation. Descriptors for the set of known individuals are stored in a tree structure, which allows us to perform queries given the descriptors from an unknown trailing edge. We evaluate the top-k accuracy on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the curvature representation, achieving top-1 accuracy scores of approximately 95\% and 80\% for bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales, respectively.},

All specimens of both new species were found in the western Indian Ocean.

Specimens of the second new species, hereafter referred to as P. annae sp. nov., were only found off Zanzibar. Pliotrema kajae sp. nov. appears to inhabit upper insular slopes and submarine ridges at depths of 214\textendash 320 m, P. annae sp. nov. so far is only known from shallow waters (20\textendash 35 m). Both new species differ from P. warreni in a number of characteristics including the known distribution range and fresh coloration. Taxonomical differences include barbels that are situated approximately half way from rostral tip to mouth, with prebarbel length equidistant from barbel origin to symphysis of the upper jaw in P. kajae sp. nov. and P. annae sp. nov. (vs. about two thirds way from rostral tip to mouth, with prebarbel length about twice the distance from barbel origin to symphysis of upper jaw in P. warreni) and rostra that are clearly and slightly constricted between barbel origin and nostrils, respectively (vs. rostrum not constricted). Pliotrema kajae sp. nov. differs from P. annae sp. nov. in a longer snout, more numerous large lateral rostral teeth and upper jaw tooth rows, jaw teeth with (vs. without) sharp basal folds, and coloration, particularly pale to light brown (vs. medium to dark brown) dorsal coloration with (vs. without) two indistinct yellowish stripes.

  abstract = {Ecologists often study wildlife populations by deploying camera traps. Large datasets are generated using this approach which can be difficult for research teams to manually evaluate. Researchers increasingly enlist volunteers from the general public as citizen scientists to help classify images. The growing number of camera trap studies, however, makes it ever more challenging to find enough volunteers to process all projects in a timely manner. Advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, allow for accurate automatic image classification. By training models using existing datasets of images classified by citizen scientists and subsequent application of such models on new studies, human effort may be reduced substantially. The goals of this study were to (a) assess the accuracy of deep learning in classifying camera trap data, (b) investigate how to process datasets with only a few classified images that are generally difficult to model, and (c) apply a trained model on a live online citizen science project. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to differentiate among images of different animal species, images of humans or vehicles, and empty images (no animals, vehicles, or humans). We used four different camera trap datasets featuring a wide variety of species, different habitats, and a varying number of images. All datasets were labelled by citizen scientists on Zooniverse. Accuracies for identifying empty images across projects ranged between 91.2\% and 98.0\%, whereas accuracies for identifying specific species were between 88.7\% and 92.7\%. Transferring information from CNNs trained on large datasets (``transfer-learning'') was increasingly beneficial as the size of the training dataset decreased and raised accuracy by up to 10.3\%. Removing low-confidence predictions increased model accuracies to the level of citizen scientists. By combining a trained model with classifications from citizen scientists, human effort was reduced by 43\% while maintaining overall accuracy for a live experiment running on Zooniverse. Ecology researchers can significantly reduce image classification time and manual effort by combining citizen scientists and CNNs, enabling faster processing of data from large camera trap studies.},

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provides one commonly used approach for image classification and detection. In this work we describe a CNN-based method for detecting dogs in potentially complex images and subsequently consider the identification of the type/breed of dogs. The results achieve nearly 85\% accuracy for breed classification for a set of 50 classes of dogs and 64\% accuracy for 120 other less common dog types. An iOS application and associated big data processing infrastructure utilizing a variety of GPUs was used to support the image classification algorithms.},

Due to the large inter-class similarity, it is very difficult to classify the objects without locating really discriminative features, therefore it becomes more important for the algorithm to make full use of the part information in order to train a robust model.},

Moreover, we propose two effective approaches to deal with sampling high-quality center examples and optimization for dense distance regression, respectively, which can significantly improve the performance and simplify the training process. Without any bells and whistles, PolarMask achieves 32.9\% in mask mAP with single-model and single-scale training/testing on challenging COCO dataset. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework achieving competitive accuracy.

However, due to the lack of strong discriminative signals, these learned representations may overfit to the pre-training objective (e.g., hashtag prediction) and not generalize well to downstream tasks. In this work, we present a simple strategy - ClusterFit (CF) to improve the robustness of the visual representations learned during pre-training. Given a dataset, we (a) cluster its features extracted from a pretrained network using k-means and (b) re-train a new network from scratch on this dataset using cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. We empirically show that clustering helps reduce the pre-training task-specific information from the extracted features thereby minimizing overfitting to the same. Our approach is extensible to different pretraining frameworks \textendash{} weak- and self-supervised, modalities \textendash{} images and videos, and pre-training tasks \textendash{} object and action classification. Through extensive transfer learning experiments on 11 different target datasets of varied vocabularies and granularities, we show that CF significantly improves the representation quality compared to the state-ofthe-art large-scale (millions / billions) weakly-supervised image and video models and self-supervised image models.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a powerful method to study the occurrence, movement and behavior of echolocating odontocetes (toothed whales) in the wild. However, in areas occupied by more than one species, echolocation clicks need to be classified into species. The present study investigated whether the echolocation clicks produced by small, at-risk, resident sympatric populations of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in Menai Bay, Zanzibar, East Africa, could be classified to allow species specific monitoring. Underwater sounds of S. plumbea and T. aduncus groups were recorded using a SoundTrap 202HF in January and June-August 2015. Eight acoustic parameters, i.e. -10 dB duration, peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies, and -3 dB, -10 dB and root-mean-squared bandwidth, were used to describe and compare the two species' echolocation clicks. Statistical analyses showed that S. plumbea clicks had significantly higher peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies compared to T. aduncus, whereas duration and bandwidth parameters were similar for the two species. Random Forest (RF) classifiers were applied to determine parameters that could be used to classify the two species from echolocation clicks and achieved 28.6\% and 90.2\% correct species classification rates for S. plumbea and T. aduncus, respectively. Both species were classified at a higher rate than expected at random, however the identified classifiers would only be useful for T. aduncus monitoring. The frequency and bandwidth parameters provided most power for species classification. Further study is necessary to identify useful classifiers for S. plumbea. This study represents a first step in acoustic description and classification of S. plumbea and T. aduncus in the western Indian Ocean region, with potential application for future acoustic monitoring of species-specific temporal and spatial occurrence in these sympatric species.},

  abstract = {Underwater noise levels may be strongly influenced by sea ice. This study presents systematic measurements of under-ice ambient noise levels in shallow ({$<$}30 m) coastal waters using passive acoustic technology. Acoustic data were collected at 6 sites with different ice concentration (two levels: incomplete and complete ice cover) and thickness (three levels: {$<$}10 cm, 10\textendash 20 cm and {$>$}20 cm) in Liaodong Bay, China. Wind (max = 5.3 m/s) and current (max = 0.3 m/s) conditions were very weak, making minimal contributions to under-ice noise in this study. Root-mean-squared broadband (20\textendash 10,000 Hz) noise levels (BNLs) and one-third-octave-band noise levels (TOLs) at 63, 125 and 2000 Hz were measured. Median BNLs of the 6 recording sites ranged from 104.5 to 129.1 dB re 1 {$\mu$}Pa, and median TOLs at 63, 125 and 2000 Hz were between 76.5 and 118.0 dB re 1 {$\mu$}Pa at the 6 sites. Generalized Linear Models were used to analyze broadband and three one-third-octave-band noise levels in different ice concentration and thickness levels. The results showed that, regardless of the ice thickness, the sites with incomplete ice concentration had higher BNLs and 63, 125 and 2000 Hz TOLs than the sites with complete ice concentration, and regardless of the ice concentration, both BNLs and all three TOLs decreased with increased ice thickness. This study provides baseline characterization of under-ice noise in shallow coastal waters and indicating that both ice concentration and thickness have significant influence on the under-ice noise levels. These findings are important for future studies investigating acoustic communication and noise pollution in shallow coastal waters with sea ice.},

In order to improve the performance of machine vision in fruit detection for a strawberry harvesting robot, Mask Region Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) was introduced.

The Region Proposal Network (RPN) was trained end-to-end to create region proposals for each feature map. After generating mask images of ripe fruits from Mask R-CNN, a visual localization method for strawberry picking points was performed. Fruit detection results of 100 test images showed that the average detection precision rate was 95.78\%, the recall rate was 95.41\% and the mean intersection over union (MIoU) rate for instance segmentation was 89.85\%. The prediction results of 573 ripe fruit picking points showed that the average error was {$\pm$}1.2\,mm. Compared with four traditional methods, the method proposed demonstrates improved universality and robustness in a non-structural environment, particularly for overlapping and hidden fruits, and those under varying illumination.},

Conventional approaches on relation extraction require an existing knowledge graph to start with or sufficient observed samples from each relation type in the training process. However, such resources are not always available, and fine-grained manual labeling is extremely time-consuming and requires extensive expertise for specific domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Additionally, the distribution of fine-grained relations is often highly imbalanced in practice. We tackle this label scarcity and distribution imbalance issue from a one-shot classification perspective via a convolutional siamese neural network which extracts discriminative semantic-aware features to verify the relations between a pair of input samples. The proposed siamese network effectively extracts uncommon relations with only limited observed samples on the tasks of 1-shot and few-shot classification, demonstrating significant benefits to domain-specific information extraction in practical applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple and effective method for regularizing large convolutional neural networks. We replace the conventional deterministic pooling operations with a stochastic procedure, randomly picking the activation within each pooling region according to a multinomial distribution, given by the activities within the pooling region. The approach is hyper-parameter free and can be combined with other regularization approaches, such as dropout and data augmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on four image datasets, relative to other approaches that do not utilize data augmentation.},

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.},

Methods for pose-normalized representations have been proposed, but generally presume bounding box annotations at test time due to the difficulty of object detection. We propose a model for fine-grained categorization that overcomes these limitations by leveraging deep convolutional features computed on bottom-up region proposals. Our method learns whole-object and part detectors, enforces learned geometric constraints between them, and predicts a fine-grained category from a pose-normalized representation. Experiments on the Caltech-UCSD bird dataset confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-grained categorization methods in an end-to-end evaluation without requiring a bounding box at test time.},

The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous system built on top of high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery, with an advanced deep learning method for detecting burned area change. This work proposes an initial exploration of using an unsupervised model for feature extraction in wildfire scenarios. It is based on the contrastive learning technique SimCLR, which is trained to minimize the cosine distance between augmentations of images. The distance between encoded images can also be used for change detection. We propose changes to this method that allows it to be used for unsupervised burned area detection and following downstream tasks. We show that our proposed method outperforms the tested baseline approaches.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, technologies of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and small imaging sensors have achieved a significant improvement in terms of equipment cost, operation cost and image quality. These low-cost platforms provide flexible access to high resolution visible and multispectral images. As a result, many studies have been conducted regarding the applications in precision agriculture, such as water stress detection, nutrient status detection, yield prediction, etc. Different from traditional satellite low-resolution images, high-resolution UAVbased images allow much more freedom in image post-processing. For example, the very first procedure in post-processing is pixel classification, or image segmentation for extracting region of interest(ROI). With the very high resolution, it becomes possible to classify pixels from a UAV-based image, yet it is still a challenge to conduct pixel classification using traditional remote sensing features such as vegetation indices (VIs), especially considering various changes during the growing season such as light intensity, crop size, crop color etc. Thanks to the development of deep learning technologies, it provides a general framework to solve this problem. In this study, we proposed to use deep learning methods to conduct image segmentation. We created our data set of pomegranate trees by flying an off-shelf commercial camera at 30 meters above the ground around noon, during the whole growing season from the beginning of April to the middle of October 2017. We then trained and tested two convolutional network based methods U-Net and Mask R-CNN using this data set. Finally, we compared their performances with our dataset aerial images of pomegranate trees. [Tiebiao- add a sentence to summarize the findings and their implications to precision agriculture]},

However, such sampling methods are costly and laborious, and insufficient relocations often prevent scientists from conducting large-range and long-term research. In this paper, we innovatively exploit the image-to-image translation technology to expand the range of wildlife habitat analysis. We proposed a novel approach for implementing time-series imageto-image translation via metric embedding. A siamese neural network is used to learn the Euclidean temporal embedding from the image space. This embedding produces temporal vectors which bring time information into the adversarial network. The well-trained framework could effectively map the probabilistic habitat models from remote sensing imagery, helping scientists get rid of the persistent dependence on animal relocations. We illustrate our approach in a real-world application for mapping the habitats of Bar-headed Geese at Qinghai Lake breeding ground. We compare our model against several baselines and achieve promising results.},

Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

State of the art algorithms enumerate a near-exhaustive list of object locations and classify each into: object or not. In this paper, we show that bottom-up approaches still perform competitively. We detect four extreme points (top-most, left-most, bottom-most, right-most) and one center point of objects using a standard keypoint estimation network. We group the five keypoints into a bounding box if they are geometrically aligned. Object detection is then a purely appearance-based keypoint estimation problem, without region classification or implicit feature learning. The proposed method performs on-par with the state-of-the-art region based detection methods, with a bounding box AP of 43.2\% on COCO test-dev. In addition, our estimated extreme points directly span a coarse octagonal mask, with a COCO Mask AP of 18.9\%, much better than the Mask AP of vanilla bounding boxes. Extreme point guided segmentation further improves this to 34.6\% Mask AP.},

On this basis, we analyzed the time and resource consumption of each step in the ML pipeline, explored the consumption concerning the ML platform and computational models, and proposed potential performance bottlenecks such as GPU utilization.
